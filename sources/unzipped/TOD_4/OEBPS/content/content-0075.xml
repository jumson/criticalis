If vanity had been ascribed to the meaner parts of the creation&#8212;if all inanimate and irrational beings, whose days are as a shadow, and who know not whence they came nor whither they go, had thus been characterized&#8212;it had, little more than accorded with our own ideas. But the humiliating truthbelongs to man, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>lord </span>of the lower creation&#8212;to man, that distinguished link in the chain of being which unites in his person mortality and immortality, heaven and earth. &quot;The <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>knoweth the thoughts of <span style='font-style:italic;'>man, </span>that they are vanity.&quot;</p>

But the charge is pointed at that which is the peculiar glory of man the intellectual part, his <span style='font-style:italic;'>thoughts. </span>It is here, if anywhere, that we excel the creatures which are placed around us. We can contemplate our own existence, dive into the past and the future, and understand whence we came and whither we go. Yet in this tender part we are touched.

If vanity had been ascribed merely to those loose and trifling excursions of the imagination which fall not under the influence of choice, a kind of comers and goers, which are ever floating in the mind, like insects in the air on a summer&#39;s evening, it had been less affecting. The soul of man seems to be necessarily active. Everything we see, hear, taste, feel, or perceive, has some influence upon thought, which is moved by it as leaves on the trees are moved by every breeze of wind. But &quot;thoughts&quot; here include those exercises of the mind in which it is voluntarily or intensely engaged, and in which we are in earnest; even all our schemes, contrivances, and purposes.

would think, if there were anything in man to be accounted of, it should be those exercises in which his intellectual faculty is seriously and intensely employed. Yet the Lord knoweth that even these are vanity.</span></p>

If during our state of childhood and youth only vanity had been ascribed to our thoughts, it would have been less surprising. This is a truth of which numberless parents have painful proof; yea, and of which children themselves, as they grow up to maturity, are generally conscious. Vanity at this period, however, admits of some apology. The obstinacy and folly of some young people, while they provoke disgust, often excite a tear of pity.

L The Great God has made affliction the occasion of converting sinners, and bringing them into a spiritual acquaintance with Christ his Son. See Isa. xlviii. 10. II. God not only makes affliction the occasion of converting sinners at first, but after conversion he sanctifies an afflicted state to the saints, to weaken the remains of indwelling sin in them, and make them afraid of sinning against him in future time. III. God, in afflicting the saints, increases that good work of grace, which his Spirit has implanted in them. God causes his saints to grow in grace, when he corrects them with the rod of sorrow; God assimilates and makes the saints like unto himself, in a greater degree, by temporal troubles and distresses. Heb. xii. 10, 11. IV. God afflicts the saints for the improvement of their knowledge in divine things. The Psalmist says, in the words of the text, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou- </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>chastenest, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>teachest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>law.&quot; </span>See also Ps. cxix. 71. V. The great God, by afflicting the saints, brings them unto him with greater nearness and frequency, by prayer and supplication. VI. God afflicts the saints, to make them better acquainted with the perfections of his nature. VII. To make them more conformed to Christ his Son. VIII. To subdue the pride of their hearts, and make them more humble. IX. God oftentimes discovers to the saints, in the season of their affliction, in a clearer manner, that grace which he has implanted in them, and refreshes their souls with the consolations of his Spirit. X. God afflicts the saints, to divide their hearts more fiom the love of the world, and to make them more meet for heaven. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Outline </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Farmer, </span>1744.</p>

The word, then, is the storehouse of all instruction. Look not for any new diverse doctrine to be taught thee by affliction, which is not in the word. For, in truth, herein stands our teaching by affliction, that it fits and prepares us for the word, by breaking and subdividing the stubbornness of our hearts, and making them pliable, and capable of the impression of the word. Wherefore, as the Apostle saith, that the law is our schoolmaster to Christ, Gal. iii. Because the law, by showiug unto us our disease, forceth us to the physician. So likewise it may be said that afflictions are schoolmasters to the law. For whilst<a id='GBS.PA307.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.320.1.0.box.212.330.1296.390.q.60'>
we are at ease and in prosperity, though the sons of thunder terrify never so much with the fearful cracks of legal menaces, yet are we as deaf men, nothing moved therewith. But when we are humbled and meekened by affliction, then is there way made for the terrors of the law; then do we begin with some reverence of attention to listen and give ear unto thera. When therefore God sends us any affliction, we must know that then he sends us to the law and to the testimony. For he teaches us indeed in our affliction, but it is in his law. And therefore if in our affliction we will learn anything, we must take God&#39;s book into our hands, and carefully and seriously peruse it. And hereby shall it appear that our afflictions have been our teachers, if by them we have felt ourselves stirred up to greater diligence, zeal, and</span></p>

But because the distress of the church&#39;s enemies of itself could be no. sufficient matter of comfort unto her, therefore a second argument of further and that far more effectual consolation is added in this twelfth verse, drawn from the happy condition of the church, even while she is thus overborne with those tigerly and tyrannical persecutors. And the argument is propounded by the prophet, not directing his speech to the church, but rather in his own person, bringing in the church suddenly turning her speech from her enemies, with whom she was expostulating, to God himself, and breaking forth into this pathetical expostulation, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Blemed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>chastenest, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>teachest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span>inc.&quot; Prom the coherence of which words with the former, we may observe, that the outward miseries of our enemies is but cold comfort, unless withal we have a persuasion of our own inward happiness. ... It would do the child little good to see the rod cast into the fire, if he himself should be cast in after it. Therefore the church having in this place meditated of the just judgments of God, which should in due time befall her adversaries, and not finding sufficiency of comfort therein, here in this verse proceedeth to a further m-ditation of her own case and condition. Wherein she seemeth thus to reason to herself. What though these mine enemies be brought to their deserved ends? what though I know they be reserved for shame and confusion? What ease can this bring to my mind now dejected, and happy thinking itself as miserable as these my foes? Now these doubtful thoughts something disquieting her, further comfort is ministered unto her by the Spirit of God in this verse, whereby she is enabled to answer that objection she made against herself, namely, that she is assured, that as her adversaries&#39; case is wretched, so is her own most happy and blessed.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Daniel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dyke, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Schoole </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Affliction,&quot; </span>1633.</p>

Now we know that in a bough there are two things especially considerable, as pertinent to our present puipose. First, there&#39;s the <span style='font-style:italic;'>perplexity </span>of it. And, secondly, there&#39;s the <span style='font-style:italic;'>agitation. </span>Boughs usually catch, and intangle one in another, and boughs they are easily shaken, and moved up aud down by the wind.

So that this expression does serve very well to imitate and set foith unto us the perplexity and inconstancy of thoughts, which David was now troubled withal, and wheieof he now complains, as glievous and offensive to him.

branches of trees. The idea in the psalmist&#39;s mind appears to be this: &#39;Look at a tree, with its branches shooting in every direction, entangling and entwining themselves one with another; let the wind take them&#8212;see how they feel it, how restless they become and confused, beating against and striving one with another. Now my mind is like that tree. I have a great many thoughts in it; and thoughts which are continually shifting and changing; they are perplexed and agitated thoughts, battling one with another. There is no keeping the mind quiet uuder them; they bring disorder into it as well as sorrow.&quot; And mark the word <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;multitude&quot; </span>in the text; there is exactly the same idea in that. It signifies more than number; confusion. Think of a crowd collected and hurrying about: &#39;so,&#39; says the psalmist, &#39;are my thoughts. I have a crowd of them in my mind, and a restless confused crowd. One painful thought is bad enough, but I have many; a multitude of them; and almost countless, a disturbed throng.&#39; We now, then, understand the case we have before us. The man&#39;s sorrow arose, at this time, from disquieting thoughts within his own breast; and his sorrow was great, because these thoughts were many, and at the same time tumultuous. When the psalmist says, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comforts,&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>he means more than comforts of which God is the author or giver. God is the author and giver of all our comfotts &#8212;of all the earthly comforts that surround us; they are all the woik and gitt of his gracious hand. . . We are to understand <span style='font-style:italic;'>here </span>such comforts as are peculiarly and altogether God&#39;s, such as flow at once from God; not from him through creatures to us, but from him immediately to us without the intervention of creatures. The comforts that we get from his attributes&#8212;from meditating on, and what we call realising them; the comforts we get from his promises&#8212;believing and hoping in him ; and the comforts of his presence, he drawing near to our souls and shining into them&#8212;we knowing he is near us, conscious of it by the light and happiness and renewed strength within us. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thy </span>comforts&quot;&#8212;the comforts we get from the Lord Jesus Christ; from looking at him, considering him; thinking of his person, and offices, and blood, and righteousness, and intercession, and exaltation, and glory, and his second coming; our meeting him, seeing him, being like him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thy </span>comforts&quot;&#8212; the comforts which come from the Holy Spirit, &quot;the Comforter&quot; : when he opens the Scriptures to us, or speaks through ceremonies and ordinances, or witnesses within us of our adoption of God; shining in on his own work of grace in our hearts ; enabling us to see that work, and to see in it God&#39;s peculiar, eternal love to us; not opening to us the book of life, and showing us our names there, but doing something that makes us almost as joyful as though that book were opened to us; showing us the hand of God in our own souls &#8212;his converting, saving hand&#8212;his hand apprehending us as his own ; making us feel as it were, his grasp of love, and feel, too, that it&#39; is a grasp which he will never loosen.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Charles </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bradley. </span></span></p>
