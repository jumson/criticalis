In accordance with this, we read, in 1 Chron. xx. 14, that the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jehasiel, of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. This Jehasiel is probably the author of the Psalm. Our Psalm is a true picture of the state of feeling which prevailed throughout the people during the danger under Jehoshaphat. According to the history of Chronicles, they praised God at that time, in the midst of their danger, with loud voice, ver. IS); and here in the title, which is an appendage to that of Ps. xlviii., the Psalm is called a <span style='font-style:italic;'>song </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>and it is such in reality, although it bears the form of a <span style='font-style:italic;'>prayer, </span>&#8212; a song of triumph sung before the victory,&#8212;no contest, no doubt, the distress is simply committed to God.</p>

Ewald&#39;s assertion that Amalek stands here &quot; only as a name of infamy applied to parties well-known at the time,&quot; is to be considered as a miserable shift. The Psalm must have been composed previous to the extension of the empire of the Assyrians over Western Asia.

Their hostility was founded upon hatred. From their conduct to the Israelites through a long course of years it would seem as though in them were lastingly perpetuated that older hatred wherewith their forefather Esau had hated Jacob because of Isaac&#39;s blessing. And though they had once and again succeeded, according to the prophecy, in breaking Israel&#39;s yoke from off their neck, yet they never could wrest away from Isiael the possession of the birthright, and with it of the promises, which their ancestors had profanely despised : from Israel, not from Edom, was the Redeemer of the world to spring, and in Israel were all the families of the earth to bo blessed. The Edomites may accordingly be appropriately <span style='font-style:italic;'>\ </span>viewed as the types of those whom the Church of Christ has ever found her bitterest foes, the scepties who have refused to acknowledge that redemption through a personal Redeemer, on which, as on a basis, the church is founded, whose intellectual pride is offended by the humbling doctrines of Chiistianity, and who hate those that hold them for their possession of blessings which <span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span>have wilfully neglected; whose human learning has nevertheless all along been subservient on the whole to the edification of the church, in spite of the violence with which they have striven, and for a while, as it would sometimes appear, successfuly, to gain the mastery over her by opposing her, and to exercise a temporary dominion. Dwelling themselves in tabernacles, they cannot bear that others, more blessed than they, should have the houses of God in possession: &#39;- owning themselves to be astray, and unable to find the way to the truth, they are yet most importunate and imperious that others should come away from the ancient piths, and try to join them, or at least, wander as they are wandering.&quot; In conjunction with the Edomites, the psalmist m:ikes mention of the Ishmaelites. And these, as the descendants of the bondwoman, may fitly represent those Jewish opponents of Christianity, still, perhaps, locally, if not generally, formidable, who in their rejection of Christian doctrine have been swayed by the same feelings of intellectual pride as the scepties of Christian descent; who professing to hold fast to that covenant of Mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage, persecuted, so long as they were able, those born after the Spirit</p>

The historical origin of the former marks them as the appropriate representatives of the slaves of sinful lusts; who hate the church not for the humbling tone of her doctrines, but for the standard of holiness which she exacts and for which she is continually witnessing. And experience shews how such persons are wont, in their attacks upon the church, to enlist into their service those who are more wildly, but at the same time more ignorantly, unholy than themselves ; how in order, if possible, to uproot those fences and safeguards of the law of holiness on which, having transgressed them, they hate to look, they appeal to the unbridled passions of the lawless multitude by whom the very existence of the fences had been utterly disregarded.</p>

The neighbourhood of Leipsic, Austerlitz, Waterloo, etc., where the principal battles were fought some fifteen or twenty years before, were swept alike of the bones of the hero, and the horse which he rode. Thus collected from every quarter, they were shipped to Hull, and thence forwarded to the Yorkshire bone-grinders, who, by steam-engines and powerful machinery, reduced them to a granulary state. In this condition they were sent chiefly to Doncaster, one of the largest agricultural markets of the country, and were there sold to the farmers to manure their lands. The oily substance gradually evolving as the bone calcines, makes better manure than almost any other substance&#8212;particularly human bones.--A&#39;. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Arvine. </span></p>

It is a wild artichoke. We can amuse ourselves with it and its behaviour for a while, and may possibly extract something more valuable than the insipid juiceof which our men are so fond. You observe that in growing it throws out numerous branches of equal size and length in all directions, forming a sort of sphere or globe a foot or more in diameter. When ripe and dry in autumn, these branches become rigid and light as a feather, the parent stem breaks off at the ground, and the wind carries these vegetable globes whithersoever it pleaseth. At the proper season thousands of them come scudding over the plain rolling, leaping, bounding with vast racket, to the dismay both of the horse and his rider. Once, on the plain north of Hamath, my horse became quite unmanageable among them.

I have long suspected that this wild artichoke is the <span style='font-style:italic;'>gulgal, </span>which, in Psalm lxxxiii. 13, is rendered <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;wheel,&quot; </span>and in Isaiah xvii. 13, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rolling </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thing.&quot; </span>Evidently our translators knew not what to call it. The first passage reads thus: &quot;O my God, make them like a wheel&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>gulgal</span>&#8212;as the stubble before the wind,&quot; and the second. &quot;Rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>gulgal</span>&#8212;before<a id='GBS.PA60.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.73.1.0.box.289.289.1295.705.q.60'>
the whirlwind.&quot; Now, from the nature of the parallelism, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>gulgal </span>cannot be a &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>wheel,&quot; </span>but something corresponding to chaff. It must also be something that does not fly like the chaff, but in a striking manner <span style='font-style:italic;'>rolls </span>before the wind. The signification of <span style='font-style:italic;'>gulgal </span>in Hebrew and its equivalent in other Shemitic dialects, requires this, and this rolling artichoke meets the case most emphatically, and especially when it rolls before the whirlwind. In the encounter referred to north of Hamath, my eyes were half blinded with the stubble and chaff which filled the air; but it was the extraordinary behaviour of this &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>rolling </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thing&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>that riveted my attention. Hundreds of these globes, all bounding like gazelles in one direction over the desert, would suddenly wheel short round at the bidding of a counter-blast, and dash away with equal speed on their new course. An Arab proverb addresses this &quot;rolling thing&quot; thus: &quot;Ho! &#39;akkub, where do you put up to-night?&quot; to which it answers as it flies, &quot;Where the wind puts up.&quot; They also derive one of their many forms of cursing from this plant: &quot;May you be whirled, like the &#39;akkftb, before the wind, until you are caught in the thorns, or plunged into the sea.&quot; If this is not the &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>wheel </span>&quot; of David, and the &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>rolling </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thing&quot; </span>of Isaiah, from which they also borrowed their imprecations upon the wicked, I have seen nothing in the country to suggest the comparison.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomson, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Land </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Book.&quot; </span></span></p>
