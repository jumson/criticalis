God has given them all to us, and they ought all to join in chorus to his praise. Half-hearted, ill-conceived, unintelligent praises are not such as we should render to our loving Lord. If the law of justice demanded all our heart and soul and mind for the Creator, much more may the law of gratitude put in a comprehensive claim for the homage of our whole being to the God of grace. It is instructive to note how the psalmist dwells upon the <span style='font-style:italic;'>holy </span>name of God, as if his holiness were dearest to him; or, perhnps, because the holiness or wholeness of God was to his mind the grandest motive for rendering to him the homage of his nature in its wholeness. Babes may praise the divine goodness, but fathers in grace magnify his holiness. By <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span>we understand the revealed character of God, and assuredly those songs which are suggested, not by our fallible reasoning and imperfect observation, but by unerring inspiration, should more than any others arouse all our conseci ated powers.</span></p>

It will be profitable for any one of us who may be at this time out of conscious fellowship with the Lord, to inquire at his hands the reason for his anger, saying, &quot;Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me?&quot; For he is easily entreated of, and soon ceaseth from his wrath.

As the lofty heavens canopy the earth, water it with dews and rains, enlighten it with sun, moon, and stars, and look down upon it with unceasing watchfulness, even so the Lord&#39;s mercy from above covers all his chosen, enriches them, embraces them, and stands for ever as their dwellingplace. The idea of our version is a very noble one, for who shall tell how exceeding great is the height of heaven?

Godly fear is one of the first products of the divine life in us, it is the beginning of wisdom, yet it fully ensures to its possessor all the benefits of divine mercy, and is, indeed, here and elsewhere, employed to set forth the whole of true religion. Many a true child of God is full of filial fear, and yet at the same time stands trembling as to his acceptance with God; this trembling is groundless, but it is infinitely to be preferred to that baseborn presumption, which incites men to boast of their adoption and consequent security, when all the while they are in the. gall of bitterness. Those who are presuming upon the infinite extent of divine mercy, should here be led to consider that although it is wide as the horizon and high as the stars, yet it is only meant for them that fear the Lord, and as for obstinate rebels, they shall have justice without mercy measured out to them.</span></p>

Sin is removed from us by a miracle of love! What a load to move, and yet is it removed so far that the distance is incalculable. Fly as far as the wing of imagination can bear you, and if you journey through space eastward, you are further from the west at every beat of your wing. If sin be removed so far, then we may be sure that the scent, the trace, the very memory of it must be entirely gone. If this be the distance of its removal, there is no shade of fear of its ever being brought back again; even Satan himself could not achieve such a task. Our sins are gone, Jesus has borne them away. Far as the place of sunrise is removed from yonder west, where the sun sinks when his day&#39;s journey is done, so far were our sins carried by our scapegoat nineteen centuries ago, and now if they be sought for, they shall not be found, yea, they shall not be, saith the Lord. Come, my soul, awaken thyself thoroughly and glorify the Lord for this richest of blessings. Hallelujah. The Lord alone could remove sin at all, and he has done it in a godlike fashion, making a final sweep of all our transgressions.</p>

These he pities, for in the very best of men the Lord sees much to pity, and when they are at their best state they till need his compassion. This should check every propensity to pride, though at the same time it should yield us the richest comfort. Fathers feel for their children, especially when they are in pain, they would like to suffer in their stead, their sighs and groans cut them to the quick: thus sensitive towards us is our heavenly Father. We do not adore a god of stone, but the living God, who is tenderness itself. He is at this moment compassionating us, for the word is in the present tense; his pity never fails to flow, and we never cease to need it.</p>

If Abraham rejoiced concerning his seed, so also may the godly, for &quot; instead of the fathers shall be the children,&quot; and as the last psalm told us in its concluding verse, &quot;the children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.&quot;</span></p>

That were to encourage vice. From the manner in which some men unguardedly preach the covenant, one might infer that God would bless a certain set of men however they might live, and however they might neglect his laws. But the word teaches not so. The covenant is not legal, but it is holy. It is all of grace from first to last, yet it is no panderer to sin; on tne contrary, one of its greatest promises is, &quot;I will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will I write them&quot; ; its general aim is the sanctifying of a people unto God, zealous for good works, and nil its gifts and operations work in that direction. Faith keeps the covenant by looking alone to Jesus, while at the same time by earnest obedience it remembers the Lord&#39;s commandments to do them.</p>

God is the only fountain of being and happiness, from which all good ever flows; and hence he is said to bless his creatures when he bestows mercies and favours upon them, gives them any endowments of body and mind, delivers them from evils, and is the source of their present comforts and future hopes. But in this sense, you&#39;ll see there is no possibility of any creature&#39;s blessing God; for as his infinite and unblemished perfection renders him incapable of receiving any higher excellency, or improvement in happiness ; so, could we put the supposition that this immense ocean of good might be increased, it is plain that we, who receive our very being and everything that we have or are from him, could in no case contribute thereto. To <span style='font-style:italic;'>bless </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span>then, is, with an ardent affection humbly to acknowledge those divine excellencies, which render him the best and greatest of beings, the only object worthy of the highest adoration : it is to give him the praise of all those glorious attributes which adorn hi;; nature, and are so conspicuously manifested in his works and ways. To bless God, is to embrace every proper opportunity of owning our veneration and esteem of his excellent greatness, and to declare to all about us, as loudly as we can. the goodness and grace of his conduct towards men, and our infinite obligations for all our enjoyments to him, <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>live, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>move, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>being. </span>And a right <span style='font-style:italic;'>blessing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>must take its rise from a heart that is full of esteem and gratitude, which puts life into the songs of praise.</p>

That person best exalts the glory of the divine power, who fears God above all, and trembles at the apprehensions of his wrath ; and of his justice, who flees from sin, which exposes him to the inexorable severity thereof; and of his love, who is softened thereby into grateful returns of obedience; and then wc celebrate his holiness, when we endeavour to imitate it in our lives, and abandon everything that is an abomination to the eyes of his purity.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Willinm </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dunlop, </span>1692&#8212;1720.</p>

His eternity, and knowledge, and power, without justice, and goodness, and truth, might indeed frighten and confound us; but could not inflame our love, or engage us to hearty blessing. But when infinite mightiness, and unerring wisdom, and eternal dominion, are mixed with unchangeable love, and inviolable veracity and goodness, which exalts itself above all his works; when thus it becomes a <span style='font-style:italic;'>holy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name, </span>then the divine perfections are lendered truly amiable, and suitable objects of our hope and confidence and loudest songs; so that you see how elegantly the psalmist upon this occasion mentions the purity of God: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Bless </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>holy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name.&quot; </span></p>

Hence are those soliloquies and discourses which we find holy men use with their own hearts to bring them into a gracious temper, suitable for communion with God in ordinances. It seems [by these verses] David either found or feared his heart would not be in so good a frame as he desired; consequently he redoubles his charge : he found his heart somewhat drowsy, which made him thus rouse himself. - <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gnrnall. </span></p>

If so much as the very smallest iniquity, in thought, word, or act, were left unforgiven, we should be just as badly off, just as far from God, just as unfit for heaven, just as exposed to hell, as though the whole weight of our sins were yet upon us. Let the reador ponder this deeply. It does not say, &quot;Who forgiveth thine iniquities previous to conversion.&quot; There is no such notion as this in Scripture. When God forgives, he forgives like himself. The source, the channel, the power, and the standard of forgiveness are all divine. When God cancels a man&#39;s sins, he does so according to the measure in which Christ bore those sins. Now, Christ not only bore <span style='font-style:italic;'>some </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>many </span>of the believer&#39;s sins, he bore them &quot;all,&quot; aud, therefore, God forgives <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;all.&quot; </span>God&#39;s forgiveness stretches to the length of Christ&#39;s atonement; and Christ&#39;s atonement stretches to the length of every one of the believer&#39;s sins, past, present, and future. &quot;The blood of Jesus Christ his Son clcanseth us from <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>sin.&quot; 1 John i.&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>New </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Old,&quot; </span>1858.</p>

Thirdly, as to his spiritual state, or the heightening of his gifts, graces, and comforts. &#39;Tis probable David had found a declension in all these, and at lust, through the goodness of God and his blessing upon him, the renewing of them all from that oldness to a youthfulness again, like that of eagles.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl. </span></p>

Does the <span style='font-style:italic;'>innocence </span>of youth attract you? In the natural life it is but too frequently a misleading appearance; but in the life of the soul it returns to a certain extent when the heart is purified through the power of the Holy Ghost, and the life is renewed in conformity with that of Christ the Lord. Does the <span style='font-style:italic;'>enjoyment </span>of youth surpass in your estimation that of any other here below? Be it so; yet all too speedily it is driven away by the cares of later years, whilst enjoyment free from care even in the dark days may dwell in the heart whereon has descended the peace of God through faith. The <span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span>of youth, seems it to you desirable? Ah! day by day stamps truth upon the words: &quot;Youth shall faint and be weary;&quot; but even when the natural strength has already long attained its zenith, the Christian often feels himself elevated through a power from on high, which lifts him above physical weakness; and what no strength of sinew or muscle could accomplish is attained through the power of implicit faith. Yea, even the beautiful <span style='font-style:italic;'>development </span>which the period of youth shows you, ye would not seek in vain in that man who, leaning on God&#39;s hand, forgetting the things that are behind, stretches forward from light to light, from strength to strength, from bliss to bliss. How, finally, can <span style='font-style:italic;'>hope, </span>that makes the youthful heart beat high with throbs of joy, be lacking to him? The fairest part of life the sensual man sees soon behind him, the spiritual man always in prospect; and like the eagle, this last can often from the low atmosphere round him soar to the pure, clear ether, whence already from afar the image, nay, the ineffable reality, shows him a more than earthly joy.</p>
