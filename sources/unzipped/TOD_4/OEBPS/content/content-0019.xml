in praise, for this God is our God. It is to be regretted that the niceties of modern singing frighten our congregations from joining lustily in the hymns. For our part we delight in full bursts of praise, and had rather discover the ruggedness of a want of musical training than miss the heartiness of universal congregational song. The gentility which lisps the tune in wellbred whispers, or leaves the singing altogether to the choir, is very hke a mockery of worship. The gods of Greece and Rome may be worshipped well enough with classical music, but Jehovah can only be adored with the heart, and that music is the best for his service which gives the heart most play.</span></p>

The Lord&#39;s people in the olden time welcomed the times appointed for worship; let us feel the same exultation, and never speak of the Sabbath as though it could be other than &quot; a delight&quot; and &quot; honourable.&quot; Those who plead this passage as authority for their man-appointed feasts and fasts must be moonstruck.

When it can be proved that the observance of Christmas, Whitsuntide, and other Popish festivals was ever instituted by a divine statute, we also will attend to them, but not till then. It is as much our duty to reject the traditions of men, as to observe the ordinances of the Lord. We ask concerning every rite and rubric, &quot;Is this a law of the God of Jacob ?&quot; and if it be not clearly so, it is of no authority with us, who walk in Christian liberty.</p>

The reply is. that the Lord here speaks as the God of Israel identifying himself with his own chosen nation, and calling that an unknown tongue to himself which was unknown to them. He had never been adored by psalm or prayer in the tongue of Egypt; the Hebrew was the speech known in his sacred house, and the Egyptian was outlandish and foreign there. In strictest truth, and not merely in figure, might the Lord thus speak, since the wicked customs and idolatrous rites of Egypt were disapproved of by him, and in that sense were unknown. Of the wicked, Jesus shall say, &quot;I never knew you;&quot; and probably in the same sense this expression should be understood, for it may be correctly rendered, &quot;a speech I knew not I am hearing.&quot; It was among the griefs of Israel that their taskmasters spake an unknown tongue, and they were thus continually reminded that they were strangers in a strange land. The Lord had pity upon them, and emancipated them, and hence it was their bounden duty to maintain inviolate the memorial of the divine goodness. It is no small mercy to be brought out from an ungodly world and separated unto the Lord.</span></p>

The God who was adored one day for his goodness was reviled the next, when the people for a moment felt the pangs of hunger and thirst. The story of Israel is only our own history in another shape. God has heard us, delivered us, liberated us, and too often our \inbelief makes the wretched return of mistrust, murmuring, and rebellion. Great is our sin; great is the mercy of our God : let us reflect upon both, and pause a while. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Selah.&quot; </span>Hurried reading is of little benefit; to sit down a while and meditate is very profitable.</p>

Men deserted of restraining grace, sin with deliberation ; they consult, and debate, and consider, and then elect evil rather than good, with malice aforethought and in cool blood.

Sin strips a man of his armour, and leaves him naked to his enemies. Our doubts and fears would long ago have been slain if we had been more faithful to our God. Ten thousand evils which afflict us now would have been driven far from us if we had been more jealous of holiness in our walk and conversation. We ought to consider not only what sin takes from our present stock, but what it prevents our gaining: reflection will soon show us that sin always costs us clear. If we depart from God, our inward corruptions are sure to make a rebellion. Satan will assail us, the world will worry us, doubts will annoy us, and all through our own fault. Solomon&#39;s departure from God raised up enemies against him, and it will bo so with us, but if our ways please the Lord he will make even our enemies to be at peace with us.</p>

This shows us by contrast how sad a thing it is for a child of God to sell himself into captivity to sin, and bring his soul into a state of famine by following after another god.</span></p>

The Greek word psalterion denotes a stringed instrument played with the fingers. Cassiodorus says that the psaltery was triangular in shape, and that it was played with a bow. Aben Ezra evidently considered it to be a kind of pipe, but the mass of authorities make it a stringed instrument. It was long in use, for we read of it in David&#39;s time as made of fir-wood (2 Sam. vi. 5), and in Solomon&#39;s reign, of algum trees (2 Chr. ix. 11), and it was still in use in the days of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

The voice of God, and the voice of the trumpet on Mount Sinai, were heard together (Ex. xix. 5, 18, 19), first the trumpet-sound as the symbol, then the reality. So also John heard the voice of the Lord as that of a trumpet (Rev. i. 10; iv. 1), and the sound of the trumpet is once and again spoken of as the harbinger of the Son of Man. when coining in power and great glory, to utter the almighty word which shall quicken the dead to life, and make all things new (Matthew xxiv. 31 ; 1 Cor. xv. 52; 1 Thess. iv. 16).

In this case, it would be a call to a greater than the usual degree of alacrity and excitement in regard to the work and service of God.

Warmth and fervency in prayer. To open the mouth is in effect to open the heart, that it may be both engaged and enlarged. . . . We may be said to open our mouths wide when our affections are quick and lively, and there is a correspondence between the feelings of the heart and the request of the lips; or when we really pray, and not merely seem to do so. This is strongly and beautifully expressed in Psalm cxix. 131 : &quot;I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.&quot; ... 2. It implies a holy fluency and copiousness of expression, so as to order our cause before him, and fill our mouths with arguments. When the good man gets near to God, he has much business to transact with him, many complaints to make, and many blessings to implore; and, as such seasons do not frequently occur, he&#39;s the more careful to improve them. He then pours out his whole soul, and is at no loss for words; for when the heart is full, the tongue overflows. Sorrow and distress will even make those eloquent who are naturally slow of speech. ... 3. Enlarged hope and expectation. We may be too irreverent in our approaches to God, and too peremptory in our application; but if the matter and manner of our prayer be right, we cannot be too confident in our expectations from him. . . . Open thy mouth wide then, O Christian; stretch out thy desires to the uttermost, grasp heaven and earth in thy boundless wishes, and believe there is enough in God to afford thee full satisfaction Not only come, but come with boldness to the throne of grace: it is erected for sinners, even the chief of sinners. Come to it then, and wait at it, till you obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Those who expect most from God are likely to receive the most.

By praying we increase onr ability to pray, and find a greater facility in the duty. &quot;To him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly.&#39;&quot; 2.

The power of action is from God, but the viciousness of that action from our own nature. As when a clock or watch hath some fault in any of the wheels, the man that winds it up, or putting his hand upon the wheels moves them, he is the cause of the motion, but it is the flaw in it, a deficiency of something, is the cause of its erroneous motion ; that error was not from the person that made it, or the person that winds it up, and sets it on going, but from some other cause; yet till it be mended it will not go otherwise, so long as it is set upon motion. Our motion is from God,&#8212;Acts xvii. 28, &quot;In him we move,&quot;&#8212;but not the disorder of that motion. It is the fulness of a man&#39;s stomach at sea is the cause of his sickness, and not the pilot&#39;s government of the ship.</p>
