But they, like all other earthly joys, have their mixtuies and alloys, and are very precarious. We are often called to weep with our friends, and sometimes to weep over them. Grief and tears for their death are the sad tribute we pay for loving and being beloved, and living long in this world. This seems to have been the case with the author of this melancholy Psalm, where our text is. He was exercised with great afflictions of body, arid deep distress of mind. &quot;His soul was full of troubles, and his life drew nigh to the grave. He was shut up and confined by weakness and pain, and could r.ot go forth,&quot; to his business or pleasure, to the social or solemn assembly, ver. 3&#8212;8. He adds, that &quot;he had been afflicted and ready to die from his youth up,&quot; ver. 15; which seems to intimate that he was now an old man. Some of his acquaintance and friends had deserted him, and he was &quot; become an abomination to them,&quot; v. 8. They would not assist him, nor afford him the comfort of a friendly visit, and the cheap kindness of a soft, compassionate word. Others of them, who would have been faithful and kind to him in his distress, were taken cut of the world ; and this at a time when, through age and infirmities, he peculiarly needed their company and assistance. To this he refers in the text; and with this he concludes the psalm, as the heaviest stroke of all, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Lover </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>friend </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>put </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>far </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>arid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>arqvaintance </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>darkness.&quot; </span>This is a common case; and frequently the case of the aged. It is no unusual thing for old people to outlive their nearest relations; the companions of their lives; their children, and sometimes their grandchildren too ; and they are, as the psalmist expressed! it, &quot;like a sparrow alone upon the house-top.&quot;</p>

They were put so far from him, that he could see them no more; were dead and buried out of his sight; neither would one of their friends on earth any more behold them. Thus are our friends put into darkness. The eyes that used to sparkle with pleasure, when we met after a long absence, are closed in death. The voice that used to delight and edify us is scaled up in everlasting silence. There is no conversing with them personally nor by letters. Not lands and seas divide us from them, but regions of vast, unknown space, which we cannot yet pass over; and which they cannot and indeed would not tread back, as much as they loved us. We have no way of conveying intelligence to them or receiving it from them. Perhaps they were put far awny from us in their youth, or in the midst of their days and usefulness; when we promised ourselves many years of pleasure in their friendship and converse, and expected many years of service from them, for their families, for the church, and the world. Alas! one awful, fatal stroke hath broken down all the pleasing fabric of love nnd happiness.</p>

takes no notice of their diseases ; he neither blames them for imprudence and delay, nor those who attended them for neglect or misapplication; but looks beyond all second causes to the great Lord of all ; owns him as the supreme sovereign of every life, and disposer of every event. And we shall do well to make this idea of the blessed God familiar to our minds, as it is at once most instructive and most comfortable.</span></p>

By whatever disease or casualties they die, it is God who &quot; taketh away their breath, changeth their countenance, and sendeth them into darkness.&quot; With awful majesty God claimeth this as his prerogative; &quot;I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.&quot; (Deut. xxxii. 39.) He removeth our friends who hath a right to do it. They were our friends, hut they are his creatures; and may he not do what he will with his own? He gave them life of his free goodness, and he hath a right to demand it when he pleaseth. Dear as they were to us, we must acknowledge they were sinners; and, as such, had forfeited their lives to the justice of God: and shall not ho determine when to take them away? They were our friends; but do we not hope and believe that, by repentance, faith in Christ, and sanctifying grace, they were become his friends too; dear to him by many indissoluble ties? Hath he not then a superior claim to them, and a greater interest in them? Is it not fit that ho should be served first? May he not call home his friends when ho pleaseth? Shall he wait for, or ask, our consent first? He doth it, whom we cannot, dare not, gainsay. &quot;Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, what doest thou?&quot; (Job ix. 12.) He doth it, who is infinitely good and wise; and doth everything in the best time and manner. His knowledge is perfect and unerring; his goodness boundless and never-failing. Though his judgments are a great deep, and his schemes utterly unsearchable by us; yet we may reasonably believe that he consulteth the happiness of his servants in what is most mysterious and most grievous; and his word giveth us the strongest assurance of it. So that whether we exercise the faith of Christians, or the reason of men, we must acknowledge the hand of God, yea, his wisdom and goodness, in removing our acquaintance into darkness.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Job </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Orton, </span>1717&#8212;1783.</p>

When the Lord is angry with his rebellious child, and is chastening him, he not only giveth Satan leave to trouble him, but permitteth some of the saints who are acquainted with him, to discountenance him, and by their cold treatment of him, to add to his grief. When the father of a family resolves the more effectually to correct his obstinate child, he will say to the rest of the household, &quot;Do not bo familiar with him ; shew him no countenance; put him to shame.&quot; In like manner, when the Lord is smiting, especially with spiritual trouble, his disobedient child, he, as it were, saith to others of his children, &quot;Have for a season no familiarity with him; treat him with coldness and neglect; in order that he may be ashamed, and humbled for his iniquity.&quot; Job, under his grievous affliction, complained thus, &quot;He hath put my brethren far from me, and mino acquaintance are verily estranged from me,&quot; &amp;c. (ch. xix. 13&#8212;tfl).

most part do they. If a holy man, then, under trouble of spirit, begins to be treated with disregard, and even with contempt, by some of his Christian brethren, he ought not to be surprised ; neither should he take occasion to be angry, or to quarrel with them ; but he should loo.i above them, and take the afflictive dispensation, only out of the hand of the Lord, as a necessary part of the chastisement intended for him. He ought to say with respect to them, as David concerning Shimei, &quot;The Lord hath bidden them;&quot; or, as Heman did, &quot;Tliou <span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>put </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>away </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>acquaintance </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jar </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Colquhoun. </span></span></p>
