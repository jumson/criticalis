Many a land owes its peace to the sea; if it had not been isolated it would have been desolated, and therefore the inhabitants should praise the Lord who has moated them about, and given them a defence more available than bars of brass. Jesus deserves to be Lord of the Isles, and to have his praises sounded along every sea-beaten shore. Amen, so let it be.</p>

Every revelation of God must also be an obvelation; there must be a veiling of his infinite splendour if anything is to be seeu by finite beings. It is often thus with the Lord in providence ; when working out designs of unmineled love he conceals the purpose of his grace that it may be the more clearly discovered at the end. &quot;It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.&quot; Around the history of his church dark clouds of persecution hover, and an awful gloom at times settles down, still the Lord is there; and though men for a while see not the bright light in the clouds, it bursts forth in due season to the confusion of the adversaries of the gospel. This passage should teach us the impertinence of attempting to pry into the essence of the Godhead, the vanity of all endeavours to understand the mystery of the Trinity in Unity, the arrogance of arraigning the Most High before the bar of human reason, the folly of dictating to the Eternal One the manner in which he should proceed. Wisdom veils her face and adores the mercy which conceals the divine purpose; folly rushes in and perishes, blinded first, and by-and-by consumed by the blaze of glory.</p>

Righteousness is his immutable attribute, and judgment marks his every act. What though we cannot see or understand what he doeth, yet we are sure that he will do no wrong to us or any of his creatures. Is not this enough to make us rejoice in him and adore him? Divine sovereignty is never tyrannical. Jehovah is an autocrat, but not a despot. Absolute power is safe in the hands of him who cannot err, or act unrighteously. When the roll of the decrees, and the books of the divine providence shall be opened, no eye shall there discern one word that should be blotted out. oue syllable of error, one line of injustice, one letter of unholiness. Of none but the Lord of all can this be said.</p>

Reading this verse in reference to the coming of Jesus, and the descent of the Spirit, we are reminded of the tongues of fire, and of the power which attended the gospel, so that all opposition was speedily overcome. Even uow where the gospel is preached in faith, and in the power of the Spirit, it burns its own way, irresistibly destroying falsehood, superstition, unbelief, sin, indifference, and hardness of heart. Iu it the Lord reigueth, and because of it let the earth rejoice,</p>

seems dim compared with the blnze of lightning. If such are the common lights of nature what must be the glories of the Godhead itself? When God draws aside the curtain for a moment how astonished are the nations, the light compels them to cover their eyes and bow their heads in solemn awe. Jesus in the gospel lights up the earth with such a blaze of truth and grace as was never seen or even imagined before. In apostolic times the word flashed from one end of the heavens to the other, no part of the civilised globe was left unilluminated. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saw, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trembled.&#39;&#39; </span>In God&#39;s presence the solid earth quakes, astonished by his glory it is convulsed with fear. To the advent of our Lord and the setting up of his kingdom among men these words are also most applicable; nothing ever caused such a shaking and commotion as the proclamation of the gospel, nothing was more majestic than its course, it turned the world upside down, levelled the mountains, and filled up the valleys. Jesus came, he saw, he conquered. When the Holy Ghost rested upon his servants their course was like that of a mighty storm, the truth flashed with the force and speed of a thunderbolt, and philosophers and priests, princes and people were utcerly confounded, and altogether powerless to withstand it. It shall be so again. Faith even now sets the world on fire, and rocks the nations to and fro.</span></p>

States and kingdoms which stand out upon the world like mountains are utterly dissolved when he decrees their end. Systems as ancient and firmly-rooted as the hills pass away when he does but look upon them. In the Pentecostal era, and its subsequent age, this was seen on all hands, heathenism yielded at the glance of Jehovah Jesus, and the tyrannies based upon it dissolved like melted wax. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;At </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presence </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whole </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth.&quot; </span>His dominion is universal, and his power is everywhere felt. Men cannot move the hills, with difficulty do they climb them, with incredible toil do they pierce their way through their fastnesses, but it is not so with the Lord, his presence makes a clear pathway, obstacles disappear, a highway is made, mid that not by his hand as though it cost him pains, but by his mere presence, for power goes forth from him with a word or a glance. O for the presence of the Lord after this sort with his church at this hour! It is our one and only need. With it the mountains of difficulty would flee away, and all obstacles would disappear. O that thou wouldest rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, O Lord.</p>

A man who worships an image is but the image of a man, his senses must have left him.

If the false gods are thus bidden to worship the coming Lord, how much more shall they adore him who are godlike creatures in heaven, even the angelic spirits? Paul quotes this passage as the voice of God to angels when he sent his Son into the world. AH powers are bound to recognise the chief power; since they derive their only rightful authority from the Lord, they should be careful to acknowledge his superiority at all times by the most reverent adoration.</p>

Those who are right-hearted shall also be glad-hearted. Right leads to light. In the furrows of integrity lie the seeds of happiness, which shall develop into a harvest of bliss. God has lightning for sinners and light for saints. The gospel of Jesus, wherever it goes, sows the whole earth with joy for believers, for these are the men who are righteous before the Lord.</p>

This is a terror to the wicked, and a cause of thankfulness to the gracious. To remember that Jehovah is holy is becoming in those who dwell in his courts, to give thanks in consequence of that remembrance is the sure index of their fitness to abide in his presence. In reference to the triumphs of the gospel, this text teaches us to rejoice greatly in its purifying effect; it is the death of sin and the life of virtue. An unholy gospel is no gospel. The holiness of the religion of Jesus is its glory, it is that which makes it glad tidings, since while man is left in his sins no bliss can be his portion. Salvation from sin is the priceless gift of our thrice holy God, therefore let us magnify him for ever and ever. He will fill the world with holiness, and so with happiness, therefore let us glory in his holy name, world without end. Amen.</p>

The present psalm, in language sufficiently explicit, describes the completion of this great event, &quot;the Lord reigneth;&quot; Messiah is on his throne, and now the words of the second psalm, verse 6, are fulfilled, &quot;I have set my king upon my holy hill of Sion.&quot; Messiah&#39;s first act of sovereignty is judgment. Scriptures bearing upon that event are 2 Thess. i. 7; Jude 14;&#39; Isa. lxvi. 15. The character of these judgments is given in the psalm: clouds and darkness encircling his throne, where, however, righteousness and mercy dwell; a fire which burns up his enemies round about; lightnings flashing upon the world, the earth trembling, and the hills melting like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

If you look at the history of these appearances, you will find they were all accompanied with clouds and darkness. The cloud of the Lord went before the children of Israel when they departed from the land of bondage. This cloud had a dark and bright side, and was a symbol of the divine presence. Thus it preceded the people in all their marches, as a pillar of fire by night, and of a cloud by day. When Solomon dedicated the teinplo, the glory of the Lord filled the house, and the priest could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord filled the house. When God descended upon Mount Sinai, &quot;there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud. And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, upon the top of the mount&quot; (Exod. xix. 16, 18, 20). When our Saviour was transfigured before three of his disciples, &quot;a bright cloud overshadowed them,&quot; from which proceeded the voice of the Father, saying, &quot;This is my beloved Son, in whom I<a id='GBS.PA361.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.374.1.0.box.226.299.1301.214.q.60'>
am well pleased ; hear ye him.&quot; And Peter, who was present there, afterwards referring to the fact, says that the voice proceeded &quot;from the excellent glory.&quot; Thus, in all the symbols of the divine presence, there was a mixture of splendour with darkness and obscurity. So it is in the operations of Providence: in a moral and figurative sense, we may say that clouds and darkness surround all the operations of divine power and wisdom.</span></p>

God knoweth our ways, and counteth our steps; but the wisest of men do not know all God&#39;s ways. His way is frequently in the sea, and his chariots in the clouds; so that he is invisible, not only in his essence, but also in the design and tendence of his operations. Those that behold him with an eye of faith, do not yet see him with an eye of understanding, so as to discern his way, and whither he is going. Paul assures us, &quot;His judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.&quot; Rom. xi. 33. Some of them, indeed, are obvious, plain, and easy; we may upon the first view give a satisfactory account of them; we may read righteousness, equity, mercy, goodness, love, in them, because written in capital letters, and with such beams of light as he that runs may read them. But others of God&#39;s ways are dark and obscure, so that they are out of our reach and above our sight. He that goes about in them to trace God, may quickly lose himself. They are like that hand-writing upon the wall, which none of Belshazzar&#39;s wise men could read or give the interpretation of (Dan. v. 8). There are <span style='font-style:italic;'>arcana </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>imperii, </span>&quot;secrets of state and government,&quot; which are not fit to be made common. But this may be our comfort :&#8212; though God doth not now give any account of his matters, nor is he obliged thereunto, yet he can give a very good and satisfactory account; and one day his people shall be led into the mystery ; and, though many things which God doeth they know not now, yet they shall know them afterward ; and when they know, they shall approve and admire both the things, and the reason, and the end. They shall then be perfectly reconciled to all providences, and see that all were worthy of God, and that in all he acted <span style='font-style:italic;'>Oco-rpevur, </span>&quot;as did highly become himself.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Siimuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Slater </span>(1704) <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Horning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Exercises.<sup>&quot;</sup> </span></p>

Secondly, true hatred is fixed ; there is no appeasing it but by abolishing the thing hated. Thirdly, hatred is a more rooted affection than anger: anger may be appeased, but hatred remains and sets itself against the whole kind. Fourthly, if our hatred be true, we hate all evil, in ourselves first, and then in others; he that hates a toad, would hate it most in his own bosom. Many, like Judah, are severe in censuring others (Gen. xxxviii. 24), but partial to themselves. Fifthly, he that hates sin truly, hates the greatest sin in the greatest measure; he hates all evil in a just proportion. Sixthly, our hatred is right if we can endure admonition and reproof for sin, and not be enraged ; therefore, those that swell against reproof do not appear to hate sin.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Bichard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sibbes. </span></p>

Keligious thought in this way grows into a personal feeling ; and the solid rock of truer conviction and deeper trust as a firm foundation for the soul to build upon for eternity, remains behind after all the abrasion of loose and more perishable materials through speculation. A different if not a truer revelation of heavenly realities is given to us through the dark distressing process of doubting, than through the bright joyful exercise of unhesitating faith; just as our knowledge of the chemistry of the sun and stars, of the physical constitution of distant worlds, is derived not from the bright bands of their spectrum, which reveal only their size and shape, but from Fraunhofer&#39;s wonderful lines&#8212;those black blank spaces breaking up the spectrum bands&#8212; which tell us of rays arrested in their path and prevented from bearing their message to us by particular metallic vapours. Unto the upright, just because of the purity and singleness of their motives and the earnestness of their quest after truth, there ariseth light in the darkness. We must remember that &quot;light is <span style='font-style:italic;'>sown </span>for the righteous&quot; ; that its more or less rapid germination and development depend upon the nature of the soil on which it falls and the circumstances that influence it; that, like seed, it at first lies concealed in the dark furrow, under the cheerless clod, in the cold ungenial winter; but that even then, while shining in the darkness, while struggling with doubts and difficulties of the mind and heart, it is nevertheless the source of much comfort, and in its slow, quickening, and hidden growth the cause of lively hope, and of bright anticipation of that time when it shall blossom nnd ripen in the summer-time of heaven&#8212;shine more and more unto the perfect dBy.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Hugh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Macmillan, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ministiy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Nature,&quot; </span>1871.</p>

Name what you can, and it will be a mystery, a secret thing, that belongs to the upright in heart. First, is not the decree of God a hidden thing? a depth unsearchable <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>and able to make a man astonied? Did not Paul cry out, &quot;O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out I&quot; (Rom. xii. 33). And is not the incarnation of Christ a secret too i what more to be admired than that God should become man, and be manifested in the flesh? The very angels desired to peep into this mystery. 1 Tim. iii. 16; 1 Pet. L 12; Isai. vii. 14. Again, the conversion and regeneration of a sinner is admirable ; it&#39;s a noble, yet a secret work : Nicodemus a great doctor could not see it. And if natural births be so strange, what shall we judge of this? Moreover, peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost is no open matter; none knoweth it, but he that hath it. So is the earnest of the Spirit, and true seal of salvation ; the power, life and sweetness of the word; the remission and pardon of sin, with certainty of salvation. And in the fifth place, the harvest is secret, if we consider where it is growing. One close is, <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>secret </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>purport </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>and who can understand it?

Our rejoicing in the Lord denotes our taking a very sincere and cordial pleasure in whatever relates to the everblessed God, particularly his existence, perfections, and providence; the discoveries of his will to us, especially in his word; the interest we have in him, and the relations wherein we stand to him; his continual protection, guidance and influence; his gracious intercourse with us in the duties of religious worship; and, finally, the hope he has given us of fulness of joy, in his beatific and most glorious presence above. II. Rejoicing in the Loid signifies that our joy in God is superior to all our other joys, otherwise it is a joy unworthy of him, and no way, or not savingly, profitable to us. III. Whatever else we rejoice in, we are to rejoice in such a manner, that we may be properly said to rejoice in the Lord, even when other things are the immediate occasions of our joy. The God we serve is not an envious and a malevolent Being, but exceeding liberal and kind; he has created us with an inextinguishable desire after hap<a id='GBS.PA368.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.381.1.0.box.280.284.1302.426.q.60'>pin ess, as a secret intimation that he intends to make us happy, if we do not make ourselves miserable; and while our principal happiness is lodged in himself, and to be found nowhere else, (in which he has shown the singular regaid he has to our nature), he feeds our hearts with a thousand little rivulets of joy and satisfaction from created objects: our bodies are endowed with a variety of senses and appetites, and our souls with powers and faculties of their own ; nor was any one sense or faculty made in vain, or to lie alwajs idle and useless; but every sense, and much moie every mental faculty, has not one. but a great number of things provided to entertain it. But then the soul is not to lose itself in this maze and labyrinth of delight; it is not by this variety to be diverted from that one infinite good, who eminently contains in himself all the various kinds and degrees of true joy.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Grove, </span>1683&#8212;1737-H.</span></p>

Rightly : for it is not possible for a man to praise the Lord truly and from the soul, unless he rejoices in Him. Another, that he connects the praise of God with the remembrance of his holiness. And with good reason: for it is the chief use of divine praise, that by the exercise thereof, we should keep fresh in our souls the remembrance of God and of all the blessings received from Him. Thus this verse contains the root and fruit of divine praise. The root is joy in God; the fruit is the remembrance of God and his goodness.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Musculus. </span></p>
