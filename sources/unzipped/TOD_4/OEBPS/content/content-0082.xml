Angels inaugurated the new dispensation with new songs, and shall not we take up the strain? The song is for Jehovah alone, the hymns which chanted the praises of Jupiter and Neptune, Vishnoo and Siva are hushed for ever; Bacchanalian shouts are silenced, lascivious sonnets are no more. Unto the one only God all music is to be dedicated. Mourning is over, and the time of singing of hearts has come. No dismal rites are celebrated, no bloody sacrifices of human beings are presented, no cutting with knives, and outcries of lamentation are presented by deluded votaries. Joy is in the ascendant, and singing has become the universal expression of love, the fitting voice of reverent adoration. Men are made new creatures, and their song is new also. The names of Baalim are no more on their lips, the wanton music of Ashtaroth ceaseth; the foolish ditty and the cruel war-song are alike forgotten; the song is holy, heavenly, pure, and pleasant. The psalmist speaks as if he would lead the strain and be the chief musician, he invites, he incites, he persuades to sacred worship, and cries with all his heart, &quot;O sing unto Jehovah a new song.&quot;</p>

No corner of the world is to be discordant, no race of heathen to be dumb. All the earth Jehovah made, and all the earth must sing to him. As the sun shines on all lands, so are all lands to delight in the light of the Sun of Righteousness. <span style='font-style:italic;'>E </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Pluribus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Unum, </span>out of many one song shall come forth. The multitudinous languages of the sous of Adam, who were scattered at Babel, will blend in the same song when the people are gathered at Zion. Nor men alone, but the earth itself is to praise its Maker. Made subject to vanity for a while by a sad necessity, the creation itself also is to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, so that sea and forest, field and flood, are to be joyful before the Lord. Is this a dream? then let us dream again. Blessed are the eyes which shall see the kingdom, and the ears which shall hear its songs. Hasten thine advent, good Lord! Yea, send forth speedily the rod of thy strength out of Zion, that the nations may bow before the Lord and his Anointed.</p>

Is it not unto the Three-One Lord that the enlightened nations will sing? Unitarianism is the religion of units; it is too cold to warm the world to worship; the sacred fire of adoration only burns with vehement flame where the Trinity is believed in and beloved. In other ways beside singing, the blessed Lord is to be blessed. His name, his fame, his character, his revealed word and will are to be delighted in, and remembered with perpetual thanksgiving. We may well bless him who so divinely blesses us. At the very mention of his name it is meet to say, &quot;Let him be blessed for ever.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Shew </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>day </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>day.&quot; </span>The gospel is the clearest revelation of himself, salvation outshines creation and providence; therefore let our praises overflow in that direction.

ever new, ever suitable, ever sure, ever perfect; therefore let us show it forth continually until he come, both by words and deeds, by songs and sermons, by sacred Baptism and by the Holy Supper, by books and by speech, by Sabbath services and week-day worship. Each day brings us deeper experience of our saving God, each day shows us anew how deeply men need his salvation, each day reveals the power of the gospel, each day the Spirit strives with the sons of men; therefore, never pausing, be it ours to tell out the glorious message of free grace. Let those do this who know for themselves what <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>salvation means; they can bear witness that there is salvation in none other, and that in him salvation to the uttermost is to be found. Let them show it forth till the echo flies around the spacious earth, and all the armies of the sky unite to magnify the God who hath displayed his saving health among all people.</span></p>

England has spent much blood and treasure to keep up her own prestige among barbarians; when will she be equally anxious to maintain the honour of her religion, the glory of her Lord? It is to be feared that too often the name of the Lord Jesus has been dishonoured among the heathen by the vices and cruelties of those who call themselves Christians; may this fact excite true believers to greater diligence in causing the gospel to be proclaimed as with a trumpet in all quarters of the habitable globe. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;His </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wonders </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>among </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people.&quot; </span>The gospel is a mass of wonders, its history is full of wonders, and it is in itself far more marvellous than miracles themselves. In the person of his Son the Lord has displayed wonders of love, wisdom, grace, and power. All glory be unto his name; who can refuse to tell out the story of redeeming grace and dying love? All the nations need to hear of God&#39;s marvellous works; and a really living, selfdenying church would solemnly resolve that right speedily they all shall hear thereof. The tribes which are dying out are not to be excluded from gospel teaching any more than the great growing famihes which, like the fat kine of Pharaoh, are eating up other races: Red Indians as well as Anglo-Saxons arc to hear of the wonders of redeeming love. None are too degraded, none too cultured, none too savage, and none too refined.</p>

Jehovah is great in power and dominion, great in mind and act; nothing mean or narrow can be found in him or. his acts, in all things he is infinite. Praise should be proportionate to its object, therefore let it be infinite when rendered unto the Lord. We cannot praise him too much, too often, too zealously, too carefully, too joyfully. He deserves that nothing in his worship should be little, but all the honour rendered unto him should be given in largeness of heart, with the utmost zeal for his glory. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>feared </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>above </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gods.&quot; </span>Other gods have been worshipped at great cost, and with much fervour, by their blinded votaries, but Jehovah should be adored with far greater reverence. Even if the graven images had been gods they could not have borne comparison for an instant with the God of Israel, and therefore his worship, should be far more zealous than any which has been rendered to them. He is to be feared, for there is cause to fear. Dread of other gods is mere superstition, awe of the Lord is pure religion. Holy fear is the beginning of the graces, and yet it is the accompaniment of their highest range. Fear of God is the blush upon the face of holiness enhancing its beauty.</p>

The idol gods have no existence, but our God is the author of all existences; they are mere earthly vanities, while he is not only heavenly, but made the heavens. This is mentioned as an argument for Jehovah&#39;s universal praise. Who can be worshipped but he? Since none can rival him, let him be adored alone.</span></p>

Men of the world ridiculed &quot; the Quakers&quot; for trembling when under the power of the Holy Spirit; had they been able to discern the majesty of the Eternal they would have quaked also. There is a sacred trembling which is quite consistent with joy, the heart may even quiver with an awful excess of delight. The sight of the King in his beauty caused no alarm to John in Patmos, and yet it made him fall at his feet as dead. Oh, to behold him and worship him with prostrate awe and sacred fear!</span></p>

The dominion of Jehovah Jesus is not irksome, his rule is fraught with untold blessings, his yoke is easy, and his burden is light. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>world </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>established </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moved.&quot; </span>Society is safe where God is king, no revolutions shall convulse his empire, no invasions shall disturb his kingdom. A settled government is essential to national prosperity, the reign of the god of truth and righteousness will promote this to the highest degree. Sin has shaken the world, the reign of Jesus will set it fast again upon sure foundations. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>judge </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteously.&#39;&#39; </span>This is the best method for establishing society on a secure basis, and this is the greatest source of joy to oppressed nations. Iniquity makes the dynasties of tyrants fall, equity causes the throne of Jesus to stand. He will impartially rule over Jew and Gentile, prince and peasant, and this will bring happiness to those who are now the victims of the despot&#39;s arbitrary will.</p>

It holds true to the deepest principles of our nature, that what we contemplate as possible, much more what we anticipate as ceitain, lends us the very hope and energy conducive to its realisation. On the contrary, despair paralyses effort. Is it on this account that everywhere in prophecy, old and new, there floats before us the ideal of a recovered and rejoicing world, at times transfigured into a loftier scene, the new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness? So largely did this thought imbue the prophetic mind, that the language of Paul warms into the animation of poetry, when even &quot;the creature itself,&quot; according to his own vivid personification, like some noble bird, drooping under the weight of its chain, with neck outstretched and eyeball distended, is described as looking down into the vista of coming time for its deliverance from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sous of God (Rom. viii. 10). He hastens to add, that &quot;we are saved by hope.&quot; It is true of the soul individually, we are saved by hope. It is true of our race collectively, if ever a millennium is to dawn upon it, we are saved by such a hope. Our earth may be in ruins meanwhile, blackness on the sky, barrenness on the soil, because sin is everywhere; but a change is promised. What we hope for, we labour for all the more that our hope is no dream of fancy, but has its basis in the science and certainty of absolute truth. &quot;For as the earth biingeth forth her bud, and as the garden causcth the things that are sown in it to spiing forth ; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.&quot; (Tsai. lxi. 11.) The tuning of the instrument is sometimes heaid before the music comes. The mother teaches her child to hsp a hymn before he comprehends its full scope and meaning. And so here, in this holy psalm, the Jerusalem from above, the mother of us all, trains us to the utterance of a song suitable to seasons of millennial glory, when the Moloch of oppression, the Mammon of our avarice, the Ashtaroth of fiery lust, every erring creed, every false religion, shall have given place to the worship of the one true and living God&#8212;to the faith and love of Christ. &quot;Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all (he peoples praise thee.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>H. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goold, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mission </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hymn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hebreie </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Church</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon.&quot; </span>1865.</p>

All of his attributes are glorious. but in this we have a combination of all into a still more glorious whole.

But it is not so. On the contrary, the present state of the globe is one of permanent uniformity and entire security, except those comparatively slight catastrophes which result from earthquakes, volcanoes, and local deluges. Even the climate has experienced no general change within historic times, and the profound mathematical researches of Baron Fourier have demonstrated that, even though the internal parts of the globe are in an incandescent state, beneath a crust thirty or forty miles, the temperature of the surface has long since ceased to be affected by the melted central mass; that it is not now more than one seventeenth of a degree higher than it would be if the interior were ice; and that hundreds of thousands of years will not see it lowered, from this cause, more than the seventeenth part of a degree. And as to the apprehension that the entire crust of the globe may be broken through, and fall into the melted matter beneath, just reflect what solidity and strength there must be in a mass of hard rock from fifty to one hundred miles in thickness, and your fears of such a catastrophe will probably vanish.</p>
