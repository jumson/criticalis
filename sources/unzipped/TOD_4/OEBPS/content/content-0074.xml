Who can see a nation enslaved, or even an individual downtrodden, without crying to the Lord to arise and vindicate the righteous cause? The toleration of injustice is here attributed to the Lord&#39;s being hidden, and it is implied that the bare sight of him will suffice to alarm the tyrants into ceasing their oppressions.

The sound &quot;how long?&quot; is very akin to howling, as if it were one of the saddest of all the utterances in which misery bemoans itself. Many a time has this bitter complaint been heard in the dungeons of the Inquisition, at the whipping-posts of slavery, and in the prisons of oppression.

It is the nature of workers of iniquity to boast, just as it is a characteristic of good men to be humble&#8212;will their boasts always be suffered by the great Judge, whose ear hears all that they say? Long, very long, have they had the platform to themselves, and loud, very loud, have been their blasphemies of God, and their railings at his saints&#8212;will not the day soon come when the threatened heritage of shame and everlasting contempt shall be meted out to them?</p>

He no longer complains to God or argues with men, Viut tunes his harp to softer melodies, for his faith perceives that with the most afflicted believer all is- well. Though he may not feel blessed while smarting under the rod of chastisement, yet blessed he is; he is precious in God&#39;s sight, or the Lord would not take the trouble to correct him, and right happy will the results of his correction be. The psalmist calls the chastened one a &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>man&#39;&#39; </span>in the best sense, using the Hebrew word which implies strength. He is a man, indeed, who is under the teaching and training of the Lord. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tcachest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>law.&#39;&#39; </span>The book and the rod, the law and the chastening, go together, and are made doubly useful by being found in connection. Affliction without the word is a furnace for the metal, but there is no flux to aid the purifying: the word of God supplies that need, and makes the fiery trial effectual. After all, the blessing of God belongs far rather to those who suffer under the divine hand than to those who make others suffer: better far to lie and cry out as a &quot;man&quot; under the hand of our heavenly Father, than to ronr and rave as a brute, and to bring down upon one&#39;s self a death blow from the destroyer of evil. The afflicted believer is under tuition, he is in truining for something higher and better, and all that he meets with is working out his highest good, therefore is he a blessed man, however much his outward circumstances may argue the reverse.</p>

he could not at the time perceive any one who &#39;would stand side by side with him in opposing evil ; no champion of the right was fortheoming, the faithful failed from among men. This also is a bitter trial, and a sore evil under the sun; yet it has its purpose, for it drives the heart still more completely to the Lord, compelling it to rest alone in him. If we could find friends elsewhere, it may be our God would not be so dear to us; but when, after calling upon heaven and earth to help, we meet with no succour but such as comes from the eternal arm, we are led to prize our God, and rest upon him with undivided trust. Never is the soul safer or more at rest than when, all other helpers failing, she leans upon the Lord alone. The verse before us is an appropriate cry, now that the church sees error invading her on all sides, while faithful ministers arc few, and fewer still are bold enough to &quot;stand up&quot; and defy the enemies of truth. Where are our Luthers and our Calvins? A false charity has enfeebled the most of the valiant men of Israel. Our John Knox would be worth a mint at this hour, but where is he? Our grand consolation is that the God of Knox and Luther is yet with us, and in due time will call out his chosen champions.</span></p>

Ten thousand times has this verse been true in relation to some of us, and especially to the writer of this comment. The danger was imminent, it was upon us, we were going; the peril was apparent, we saw it, and were aghast at the sight; our own heart was failing, and we concluded that it was all over with us; but then came the almighty interposition : we did not fall, we were held up by an unseen hand, the devices of the enemy were frustrated, and we sang for joy.

Nothing can last for ever but impartial right. No injustice can be permanent, for God will not set his seal upon it, nor have any fellowship with it, and therefore down it must come, and happy shall be the day which sees it fall.</p>

The dominant sect has the law on its side, and boasts that it is the national church; but the law which establishes and endows one religion rather than another is radically an injustice. God has no fellowship with it, and therefore the synagogue of Ritualism will yet be a stench in the nostrils of all sane men. What evil times aro in store for us it is not for us to prophesy; it is ours to leave the matter in the hands of him who cannot be in fellowship with an oppressive system, and will not always endure to be insulted to his face by Popish idols, and their priests.</p>

But this supplication must be regarded in its proper bearing; for David does not pray, neither should we pray, that God would take vengeance on the wicked in the same way that men, inflamed with anger and hatred, are wont often to avenge themselves of their enemies, but that He would punish them after his own divine manner and measure. The vengeance of God is for the most part a medicine for the evil; but ours is at times destruction even to the good. Therefore truly the Lord is alone the God of revenges. For we, when we think we have inflicted a penalty upon our enemy, are often much mistaken. What injury to us was the body of our enemy? iu depriving him of which we nevertheless express all our bitterness. What wounded thee and wrought thee harm and shame, was the spirit of thine enemy, and that thou art not able to seize and hold, but God is able; and He alone has such power that in no way can the spirit escape his strength and force. Leave vengeance with Him, and He will repay. He admonishes us, that if we ourselves wish to be avengers of our own pains and injuries we may hurt ourselves more deeply than our enemy: for when we take vengeance on him, we indeed wound and do violence to his body, which iu itself is vile and of little regard; but iu our own best and most precious part, that is, in our spirit; we ourselves, by losing patience, receive a deep stain, because when virtue and humanity have been expelled thence, we meanwhile incur faults to be atoned for therein. Wherefore God is entreated to become Himself the avenger of our injuires, for He alone knows aright and is able to avenge; and to become such an avenger that only the very thing which injured us may be punished. Some greedy man has cheated thee in money, may He punish avarice in him. A proud man has treated thee with scorn, may He destroy his pride, etc. . . . This is vengeance most worthy to be inflicted of God, and by us to be sought.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Jacopo </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sadoleto. </span>1477&#8212;1547.</p>

(1.) A certain spiritual <span style='font-style:italic;'>disease </span>charged on <span style='font-style:italic;'>some </span>persons, <span style='font-style:italic;'>vu. </span>darkness, and <span style='font-style:italic;'>blindness </span>of mind, appearing in their ignorance and folly. (2.) The great <span style='font-style:italic;'>degree </span>of this disease; so as to render the subjects of it <span style='font-style:italic;'>fools. </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fools, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wise?&quot; </span>And so as to reduce them to a degree of <span style='font-style:italic;'>brutishness. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>brutish </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>among </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people.&quot; </span>This ignorance and folly were to such a degree as to render men like beasts. (3.) The <span style='font-style:italic;'>obstinacy </span>of this disease; expressed in that interrogation, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>When </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wise?&quot; </span>Their blindness and folly were not only very great, but deeply rooted and established, resisting all manner of cure. (4.) Of what <span style='font-style:italic;'>nature </span>this blindness is. It is especially in things pertaining to God. They were strangely <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorant </span>of his perfections, like beasts: and had <span style='font-style:italic;'>foolish </span>notions of him, as though he did not sec, nor know : and as though he would not execute justice, by chastising and punishing wicked men. (5.) The <span style='font-style:italic;'>unreasonableness </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>sottishness </span>of the notion they had of God, that he did not <span style='font-style:italic;'>hear, </span>did not <span style='font-style:italic;'>observe </span>their reproaches of him and his people, is shown by observing that he <span style='font-style:italic;'>planted </span>the ear. It is very <span style='font-style:italic;'>unreasonable </span>to suppose that he who gave power of perceiving words to <span style='font-style:italic;'>others, </span>should not perceive them himself. And the sottishness of their being insensible of God&#39;s all-seeing eye, and particularly of his seeing their wicked actions, appears, in that God is the being who <span style='font-style:italic;'>formed </span>the eye, and gave others a <span style='font-style:italic;'>power </span>of seeing. The sottishness of their apprehension of God, as though he did not know what they did, is argued from his being the <span style='font-style:italic;'>fountain </span>and original of all knowledge. The unreasonableness of their expecting to escape God&#39;s just chastisements and judgments for sin, is set forth by his chastising even the <span style='font-style:italic;'>heathen, </span>who did not sin against tiiat light, or against so great mercies, as the wicked in Israel did; nor had ever made such a profession as they. (6.) We may observe, that this dreadful disease is ascribed to <span style='font-style:italic;'>mankind </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>general. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>knoweth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thoughts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Man, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vanity.&quot; </span>The psalmist had been setting forth the vanity and unreasonableness of the thoughts of <span style='font-style:italic;'>some </span>of the children of men; and immediately upon it he observes, that this vanity and foolishness of thought is <span style='font-style:italic;'>common </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>natural </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mankind. </span>From these particulars we may fairly deduce the following doctrinal observation: <span style='font-style:italic;'>That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>extreme </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ami </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>brutish </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blindness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>religion, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>naturally </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>possesses </span>the <span style='font-style:italic;'>hearts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mankind.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Jonathan </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Edwards. </span></p>

What in ordinary language we call the ear, is only the outer porch or entrance vestibule of a curious series of intricate, winding passages, which, like the lobbies of a great building, lead from the outer air into the inner chambers. Certain of these passages are full of air ; others are full of liquid; and their membranes are stretched like parchment curtains across the corridors at different places, and can bo thrown into vibration, or made to tremble, as the head of a drum or the surface of a tambourine does when struck with a stick or the fingers. Between two of these parchment-like curtains, a chain of very small bones extends, which serves to tighten or relax these membranes, and to communicate vibrations to them. In the innermost place of all, rows of fine threads, called nerves, stretch like the strings of a piano from the last points to which the tremblings or thrillings reach, and pass inwards to the brain. If these threads or nerves are destroyed, the power of hearing as infallibly departs as the power to give out sound is lost by a piano or violin when its strings are broken.</p>

The eye is a single chamber open to the light, and we can see into it, and observe what happens there. But the ear is many-chambered, and its winding tunnels traversing the rock-like bones of the skull are narrow, and hidden from us as the dungeons of a castle are, like which, also, they are totally dark. Thus much, however, we know, that it is in the innermost recesses of these unilluminated ivory vaults, that the mind is made conscious of sound. Into these gloomy cells, as into the bright chamber of the eye, the soul is ever passing and asking for news from the world without; and ever and anon, as of old in hidden subterranean caverns where men listened in silence and darkness to the utterance of oracles, reverberations echo along the surrounding walls, and responses come to the waiting spirit, while the world lifts up its voice and speaks to the soul. The sound is that of a hushed voice, a low but clear whisper; for as it is but a dim shadow of the outer world we see; so it is but a faint echo of the outer world we hear.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wilson, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Five </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gateways </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Knowledge,&#39;&#39; </span>1861.</p>

The eye would be useless without all the properties of light; the ear would have no power in a world without an atmosphere. Sight enables us to avoid danger, and seek distant needful objects. What a vast length of time and wearisome labour would it require for a blind man to learn what one glance of the eye may give to one blessed with sight.

We ran conceive of the power of sight as direct perception, without the aid of light, or of a special organ corresponding to the eye. But constituted as we are, we see only through the agmiy of light; and we perceive light only by a special organ ; and objects only in consequence of a peculiar structure of that organ. Of all these relationships of light to objects, and of light to the eye, and of the parts of the eye to each other, not one of them is a necessary condition of matter. The arrangement of so many things by which this wonderful power of perceiving distant objects is secured, is the only one that will secure the end desired, out of an</p>

The eye of man, though limited in its power to a certain range, gives all that the common wants of life demand. And if man needs greater range of vision, he has but to study the eye itself, and fashion instruments to increase its power; as he is able when the proper time has come in his civilization, to increase by science and art the efficacy of nearly all his physical powers. For the ordinary purposes of life, neither telescopic nor microscopic adjustment of the eye is needful.</p>

Its mechanism can be accurately examined and the use of each part as perfectly understood as any of the works of man. We examine every part of it as we would a microscope. We have first the solid case which is to hold all the machinery, and upon which are to be fastened the cords and pulleys of its skilful mounting. This covering, opaque, white, and glistening, like silver on the back and sides of the eye, in front, where the light must enter, suddenly becomes transparent as the clearest crystal. Within this is a second coating that coming to the front changes just as suddenly into an opaque screen, through the tissues of which no ray of hght can pass. That screen is selfadjusting, with a net-work that no art of man ever equalled. Whether expanding or contracting, its opening in the centre always remains a perfect circle, adapted in size to the intensity of the light. How much light shall enter the eye it determines without aid from us. Next there must be connection with the brain, the seat of the being for whom the provision is made. These two coatings arc pierced upon the back part of the eye, f.nd a thread drawn out from the brain is passad through this opening and spread out<a id='GBS.PA304.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.317.1.0.box.265.285.1296.354.q.60'>
within the eye as a delicate screen upon which all impressions are to be made. To fill the larger portion of the cavity, there is packed into it a clear jelly, and imbedded in this a lens, fashioned with a skill that no artist can equal, to refract the light and throw the image on the perceptive screen. In fiont of this lens is another humor, not like jelly as the other, because in this, that delicate fringe the iris, is to float, and nothing but a watery fluid will answer its purpose. Here then we have a great variety of materials all brought together, of the exact quality and in the quantity needed, placed in the exact position which they ought to occupy, so perfectly adjusted that the most that man can do is to imitate the eye without ever hoping to equal it.</span></p>

The instrument when finished must be mounted for use. A cavity is formed in solid bone, with grooves and perforations for all the required machinery. The eye, when placed, is packed with soft elastic cushions and fastened by strings and pulleys to give it variety and rapidity of motion. Its outer case is to cover it when not in use, and protect it when in danger. The delicate fringe upon its border never needs clipping; and set like a wellarranged defence, its points all gracefully turned back, that no ray of light may be obstructed. Above the protecting brow is another defence to turn aside the acrid fluids from the forehead, while near the eye is placed a gland that bathes the whole organ with a clear soothing fluid, to prevent all fiictiou and keep its outward lens free from dust, and polished for constant use. When we consider all this, the perfect adaptation of the eye to our wants, the arrangement of every part of its structure on strict mechanical and optical principles, and all the provisions for its protection, we pronounce the instrument perfect, the work of a Being like man, but raised immeasurably above the most skilful human workman. What shall we say when we learn that this instrument was prepared in long anticipation of its use; that there is a machinery within it to keep it in constant repair; that the Maker not only adjusted the materials, but that he was the chemist who formed all these substances from the dust of the earth? We may be told that the architect found this dust ready at hand, existing from all eternity. We may not be able to prove the contrary, nor do we need to do so for this argument. It is enough for our present purpose to know that the eyes with which we now see, these wonderfully complex and perfect instruments, were -not long since common earth, dust upon which we perchance have trod.</p>
