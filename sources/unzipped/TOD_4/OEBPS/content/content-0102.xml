Such a song would fitly lead up to godly resolutions as to his own conduct, for that which we admire in our superiors we naturally endeavour to imitate. Mercy and judgment would temper the administration of David, because he had adoringly perceived them in the dispensations of his God. Everything in God&#39;s dealings with us may fittingly become the theme of song, and we have ndt viewed it aright until we feel we can sing about it. We ought as much to bless the Lord for the judgment with which he chastens our sin, as for the mercy with which he forgives it; there is as much love in the blows of his hand as in the kisses of his mouth. Upon a retrospect of their lives instructed saints scarcely know which to be most grateful for&#8212;the comforts which have cheered them, or the nfflictions which have purged them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sing.&quot; </span>Jehovah shall have nil our praise.

David&#39;s resolve was excellent, but his practice did not fully tally with it. Alas! he was not always wise or perfect, but it was well that it was in his heart. A king had need be both sage and pure, and, if he be not so iu intent, when he comes to the throne, his after conduct will be a sad example to his people. He who does not even resolve to do well is likely to do very ill. Householders, employers, and especially ministers, should pray for both wisdom and holiness, for they will need them both. &quot;0 <span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wilt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me?&quot;</span>&#8212;an ejaculation, but not an interruption. He feels the need not merely of divine help, but also of the divine presence, that so he may be instructed, and sanctified, and made fit for the discharge of his high vocation. David longed for a more special and effectual visitation from the Lord before he began his reign. If God be with us we shall neither err in judgment nor transgress in character; his presence brings us both wisdom and holiness; away from God we are away from safety. Good men are so sensible of infirmity that they cry for help from God, so full of prayer that they cry at all seasons, so intense in their desires that they cry with sighs and groanings which cannot be uttered, saying, &quot;O when wilt thou come unto me?&quot; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walk </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>within </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perfect </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&quot; </span>Piety must begin at home. Our first duties are those within our own abode. We must have a perfect heart at home, or we cannot keep a perfect way abroad. Notice that these words are a part of a song, and that there is no music like the harmony of a gracious life, no psalm so sweet as the daily practice of holiness. Reader, how fares it with your family? Do you sing in the choir and sin in the chamber? Are you a saint abroad and a devil at home? For shame! What we are at home, that we are indeed. He cannot be a good king whose palace is the haunt of vice, nor he a true saint whose habitation is a scene of strife, nor he a faithful minister whose household dreads his appearance at the fireside.</p>

If I have wickedness brought before me by others I will turn away from it, I will not gaze upon it with pleasure. The psalmist is very sweeping in his resolve, he declines the least, the most reputable, the most customary form of evil&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span>wicked thing; not only shall it not dwell in his heart, but not even before his eyes, for what fascinates the eye is very apt to gain admission into the heart, even as Eve&#39;s apple first pleased her sight, and then prevailed over her mind and hand. <span style='font-style:italic;'>hate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>work </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tliat </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>turn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>aside.&quot; </span>He was warmly against it; he did not view it with indifference, but with utter scorn and abhorrence. Hatred of sin is a good sentinel for the door of virtue. There are persons in courts who walk in a very crooked way, leaving the high road of integrity; and these, by short cuts, and twists, and turns, are often supposed to accomplish work for their masters which simple honest hearts are not competent to undertake; but David would not employ such, he would pay no secret service money, he loathed the practices of men who deviate from righteousness. He was of the same mind as the dying statesman who said, &quot;Corruption wins not more than honesty.&quot; It is greatly to be deplored that in after years he did not keep himself clear in this matter in every case, though, in the main he did ; but what would he have been if he had not commenced with this resolve, but had followed the usual crooked policy of Oriental princes? How much do we all need divine keeping 1 We are no more perfect than David, <sub>f</sub> nay, we fall far short of him in many tiiings; and, like him, we shall find need to write a psalm of penitence very soon after our psalm of good resolution. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;It </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cleave </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>I will disown their ways, I will not imitate their policy: like dirt it may fall upon me, but I will wash it off, and never rest till I am rid of it. Sin, like pitch, is very apt to stick. In the course of our family history crooked things will turn up, for<a id='GBS.PA406.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.419.1.0.box.265.283.1293.140.q.60'>
we are all imperfect, and some of those around us are far from being what they should be; it must, therefore, be one great object of our care to disentangle ourselves, to keep clear of transgression, and of all that comes of it: this cannot he done unless the Lord both comes to us, and abides &#39;with us evermore.</span></p>

He who begins with his own heart begins at the fountain head, and is not likely to tolerate evil companions. We cannot turn out of our family all whose hearts are evil, but we can keep them out of our confidence, and let them see that we* do not approve of their ways. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wicked </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>person.&#39;&#39; </span>He shall not be my intimate, my bosom friend.

To give one&#39;s neighbour a stab in the dark is one of the most atrocious of crimes, and cannot be too heartily reprobated, yet such as are guilty of it often find patronage in high places, and are considered to be men of penetration, trusty ones who have a keen eye, and take care to keep their lords well posted up. King David would lop the goodly tree of his state of air such superfluous boughs, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>high </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>look </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>proud </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>suffer.&quot; </span>Proud, domineering, supercilious gentlemen, who look down upon the poor as though they were so many worms crawling in the earth beneath their feet, the psalmist could not bear. The sight of them made him suffer, and therefore he would not suffer them. Great men often affect aristocratic airs and haughty manners, David therefore resolved that none should be great in his palace but those who had more grace and more sense than to indulge in such abominable vanity. Proud men are generally hard, and therefore very unfit for office; persons of high looks provoke enmity and discontent, and the fewer of such people about a court the better for the stability of a throne. If all slanderers were now cut off, and all the proud banished, it is to be feared that the next census would declare a very sensible diminution of the population.</p>

It would be greatly for the profit of us all if we chose our servants rather by their piety than by their cleverness; he who gets a faithful servant gets a treasure, and he ought to do anything sooner than part with him. Those who are not faithful to God will not be likely to be faithful to men ; if we are faithful ourselves, we shall not care to have those about us who cannot speak the truth or fulfil their promises; we shall not be satisfied until all the members of our family are upright in character. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walk^th </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perfect </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>way, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>serve </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>What I wish myself to be, that I desire my servant to be.

Deceit among most orientals is reckoned to be a virtue, and is only censured when it is not sufficiently cunning, and therefore comes to be found out; it was therefore all the more remarkable that David should have so determinedly set his face against it. He could not tell what a deceitful man might be doing, what plots he might be contriving, what mischief he might be brewing, and therefore he resolved that he would at any rate keep him out of his house, that his palace might not become a den of villainy. Cheats in the market are bad enough, but deceivers at our own table we cannot bear. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>telleth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tarry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sight.&quot; </span>He would not have a liar within sight or hearing; he loathed the mention of him.

Liars are obnoxious enough on earth; the saints shall not be worried with them in another world.</p>

The righteous magistrate &quot;beareth not the sword in vain.&quot; To favour sin is to discourage virtue; undue leniency to the bad is unkindness to the good. When our Lord comes in judgment, this verse will be fulfilled on a large scale; till then he sinks the judge in the Saviour, and bids men leave their sins and find pardon. Under the gospel we also are bidden to suffer long, and to be kind, even to the unthankful and the evil; but the office of the magistrate is of another kind, and he must have a sterner eye to justice than would be proper in private persons.

Judgment must begin at the house of God. Jesus reserves his scourge of small cords for sinners inside the temple. How pure ought the church to be, and how diligently should all those who hold office therein labour to keep out and chase out men of unclean lives. Honourable offices involve serious responsibilities; to trifle with them will bring our own souls into guilt, and injure beyond calculation the souls of others. Lord, come to us, that we, in our several positions in life, may walk before thee with perfect hearts.</p>

David in some measuie may be supposed to speak of the regulation of a royal court and household; and of course with such we in our humbler sphere can have but little in common; yet though there may not be the same duties and the same requirements, yet the same principles should actuate all alike, and the same virtues that adorn the lowlier station may shed a radiance even on the highest.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Barton </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Buuchier. </span></p>

Thus, our prophet himself, as soon as the crown was settled on his head, made inquiry if there remained yet ahve any of the house of Saul, on whom he might shew mercy (2 Sam. ix.).

It is in vain to talk of holiness if we can bring no letters testimonial from our holy walking with our relations. Oh, it is sad when they that have reason to know us best, by their daily converse with us, do speak least for our godliness! Few so impudent as to come naked into the streets: if men have anything to cover their naughtiness they will put it on when they come abroad. But what art thou within doors? What care and conscience to discharge thy duty to thy near relations? IIe is a bad husband that hath money to spend among company abroad, but none to lay in provisions to keep his family at home. And can he be a good Christian that spends all his religion abroad, and leaves none for his nearest relations at home? that is, a great zealot among strangers, and little or nothing of God comes from him in his family? Yea, it were well if some that gain the reputation of Christians abroad, did not fall short of others that pretend not to profession in those moral duties which they should perform to their relations. There are some who are great strangers to profession, who yet are loving and kind in their way to their wives. What kind of professors then are they who are dogged and currish to the wife of their bosom? who by their tyrannical lording it over them embitter their spirit, and make them cover the Lord&#39;s altar with tears and weeping? There are wives to be found that are not clamorous, peevish, and froward to their husbands, who yet are far from a true work of grace in their hearts; do they then walk as becomes holiness who trouble the whole house with their violent passions? There are servants who from the authority of a natural conscience, are kept from railing and reviling language, when reproved by their musters, and shall not grace keep pace with nature? Holy David knew very well how near this part of a saint&#39;s duty lies to the very heart of godliness; and therefore, when he makes his solemn vow to walk holily before God, he instanceth this, as one stage wherein he might eminently discover the graciousness of his spirit; &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walk </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>within </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perfect </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

Moral precepts are, no doubt, offered in abundance; but these address themselves chiefly to the intellect.

And what ground hast thou, from the promise, to hope that the work should prosper in his hand that sins all the while he is doing of it ?&quot; The ploughing of the wicked is sin,&quot; Prov. xxi. 4. A godly servant is a greater blessing than we think on. He can work, and set God on work also, for his master&#39;s good : Gen. xxiv. 12, &quot;O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master.&quot; And suie ho did his master as much service by his prayer as by his piudeuce in that journey. If you were but to plant an orchard, you would get the best fruit trees, and not cumber your ground with crabs. There is more loss in a graceless servant in the house than a fruitless tree in the orchard. Holy David observed, while he was at Saul&#39;s court, the mischief of having wicked and ungodly servants, for with such was that unhappy king compassed, that David compares his court to the profane and barbarous heathens&#39;, among whom there was scarce more wickedness to be found: Ps. cxx. 6. &quot;Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar ;&quot; that is, among those who weie as prodigiously wicked as any there.
