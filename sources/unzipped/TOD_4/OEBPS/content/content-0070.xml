Whatever opposition mar arise, his throne is unmoved; he has reigned, does reign, and will reign for ever and ever. Whatever turmoil and rebellion there may be beneath the clouds, the eternal King sits above all in supreme serenity; and everywhere he is really Master, let his foes rage as they may. All things are ordered according to his eternal purposes, and his will is done. In the verse before us it would seem as if the Lord had for a while appeared to vacate the throne, but on a sudden he puts on his regal apparel and ascends his lofty seat, while his happy people proclaim him with new joy, shouting &quot; The Lord reigneth.&quot; What can give greater joy to a loyal subject than a sight of the king in his beauty? Let us repeat the proclamation, &quot;the Lord reigneth,&quot; whispering it in the ears of the desponding, and publishing it in the face of the foe. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cluthed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>majesty.&#39;&#39; </span>Not with emblems of majesty, but with majesty itself: everything which surrounds him is majestic. His is not the semblance but the reality of sovereignty. In nature, providence, and salvation the Lord is infinite in majesty. Happy are the people among whom the Lord appears in all the glory of his grace, conquering their enemies, and subduing all things unto himself; then indeed is he seen to be clothed with majesty.</p>

He is always strong, but sometimes he displays his power in a special manner, and may therefore be said to be clothed with it; just as he is always majestic essentially, but yet there are seasons when he reveals his glory, and so wears his majesty, or shows himself in it. May the Lord appear in his church, in our day, in manifest majesty and might, saving sinners, slaying errors, and honouring his own name. O for a day of the Son of man, in which the King Immortal and Almighty shall stand upon his glorious high throne, to be feared in the great congregation, and admired by all them that believe. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Wherewith </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>girded </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>himself.&quot;&#39; </span>As men gird up their loins for running or working, so the Lord appears in the eyes of his people to be preparing for action, girt with his omnipotence.

We could not be sure of anything if we were not sure that he has dominion. When he withdraws his manifest presence from among men all things are out of order; blasphemers rave, persecutors rage, the profane grow bold, and the licentious increase in wantonness; but when the divine power and glory are again manifested order is restored, and the poor distracted world is at peace again. Society would be the football of the basest of mankind if God did not establish it, and even the globe itself would fly through space, like thistle-down across the common, if the Lord did not hold it in its appointed orbit. That there is any stability, either in the world or in the church, is the Lord&#39;s doings, and he is to be adored for it. Atheism is the mother of anarchy; the reigning power of God exhibited in true religion is the only security for the human commonwealth. A belief in God is the foundation and corner-stone of a well-ordered state.</p>

Observe that the psalmist turns to the Lord when he sees the billows foam, and hears the breakers roar: he does not waste his breath by talking to the waves, or to violent men ; but like IIezckiah he spreads the blasphemies of the wicked before the Lord. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>floods </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lifted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>coice; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>floods </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lift </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waves.&quot; </span>These repetitions are needed for the sake both of the poetry and the music, but they also suggest the frequency and the violence of wicked assaults upon the government of God, and the repeated defeats which they sustain. Sometimes men are furious in words&#8212;they lift up their voice, and at other times they rise to acts of violence&#8212;they lift up their waves; but the Lord has control over them in either case. The ungodly are all foam and fury, noise and bluster, during their little hour, and then the tide turns or the storm is hushed, and we hear no more of them; while the kingdom of the Eternal abides in the grandeur of its power.</p>

When men combine to overthrow the kingdom of Jesus, plot secretly, and by-an-by rage openly, the Lord thinks no more of it than of so much noise upon the sea-beach. Jehovah, the self-existent and omnipotent, cares not for the opposition of dying men, however many or mighty they may be.</p>

marked. The enemies of God and his kingdom have risen like the floods or waves of the sea, lashed by the storm; with roaring noise have they advanced; but as they near the vessel which bears the King, their noise is that of waves dashing into foam. Their utmost nearness is &#8212;to their destruction; their utmost noise is&#8212;in breaking. And even- now, and in the height of the storm also, far overtopping not only all danger, but even its threatening noise, is Jehovah. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Jehovah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>high&quot; </span>(even there) &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mightier </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>roaring </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>many </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mighty, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>breaking </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waves </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sea&quot; </span>(the word here rendered <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;breaking </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waves&quot; </span>being literally a <span style='font-style:italic;'>derivative </span>from the verb to break). What a picture this of our safety; what an epitome of the history of God&#39;s government and of his church! Thus the calming of the storm on the lake of Galilee was not only a parabolic representation of the history of the Kingdom of God, but also typical of the final consummation of all things; a summary of the past, a prophecy of the future, a type of the end. And what applies to the Church as a whole, holds equally true of individual believers. Let us ever remember that the noise is that of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>breaking </span>wave. Our greatest dangers are only breaking waves; waves which break at his feet. The same expression is also sometimes applied to the waves of God&#39;s wrath or judgments threatening to engulf the believer, as in Ps. xlii. 7 ; lxxxviii. 7. These also, blessed be his name, are only breaking waves. Meanwhile, while waiting for the manifestation of his majesty and might, &quot;we have the more sure word of prophecy.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>testimonies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>very </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sure&quot; </span>(very reliable, literally very <span style='font-style:italic;'>Amen-ed)</span>: and, so far as we are concerned, our faith and patience are tried and proved: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Holiness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>becometh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span></span></p>

The unspeakable comfort conveyed in this assurance is ever tested in the experience of God&#39;s people. There is no truth more precious to the heart of the Christian than that &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reigneth.&quot; </span>The conviction of this must carry us far above all cares and fears. A personal God, a living God, a reigning God&#8212;alike in the armies of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth&#8212;and this God the Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,&#8212;such are the steps by which we reach a height, where, far removed from the turmoil of men, we gain a comprehensive and clear view of earth and its concerns. I would not exchange the assurance which these two words, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Jehovah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reigneth,&quot; </span>convey, for all the wisdom, combined with all the power, of this world. Received into my heart, they are the solution of every difficulty, the end of all perplexity. It seems to me as if, after puzzling over the cross-writing and hieroglyphies of men, I turned a fresh leaf, on the top of which stood these words, as the text to be preached out in all history, whether of the individual, the family, or the nation, the Church or the world. It seems as if, after revolving sorrowfully and helplessly all the difficulties and wants which distress my heart, I were at once rising above those floating clouds into clear atmosphere: as if all at once I were unburdened; as if I had reached a haven of rest; as if I had found a firm foundation, an ultimate principle. After all, in every real trial there <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span>but this one final and full comfort. What matters the opinion of men,&#8212;who may be for and who against me; who may be with me, or who may leave me. Who would speak of prospects or probabilities, of the support to be derived from wealth or power, or of the defections of friends on whose sympathy and help we had counted? <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Jehovah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reigneth!&quot; </span>There is light here across my every path, provided I follow Christ, walking in the narrow way. Only let mo be sure that, in any and every respect, I am on the Lord&#39;s side and in the Lord&#39;s way, and I ask no more. My God has all the silver and all the gold in his own hand. He holdeth the hearts of all men at his disposal; he directeth all events, from the least to the greatest. If I want power with God or with men,<a id='GBS.PA287.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.300.1.0.box.226.298.1304.349.q.60'>
let me pray; for, Jehovah reigneth. Nor let me think that special interpositions are either impossible or rare. They are constant. The course of God&quot;s providence is one of constant interposition; for &quot;all things work together for good to them that love God.&quot; Only these interpositions are not violent, and therefore not noticed by the superficial observer; they are the interpositions of all-wise and almighty God, not of poor, weak man; they are the <span style='font-style:italic;'>interpositions, </span>not <span style='font-style:italic;'>interferences</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>they are the working of the machinery by the Master-mind which designed, and the Master-hand which framed it. They are not the stoppage, but the working of the machinery, whereby its real object is wrought out.</span></p>
