No man certainly commits sin, but with a design of pleasure; but sin will not be so committed; for whosoever commit sin, let them he sure at some time or other to find a thousand times more trouble about it than ever they found pleasure in it.

That is God&#39;s set time when the church is most believing, most humble, most affectionate to God&#39;s interest in it, and most sincere. Without faith we are not fit to desire mercy, without humility we are not fit to receive it, without affection we are not fit to value it, without sincerity we are not fit to improve it, Times of extremity contribute to the growth and exercise of these qualifications. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Stephen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Churnock. </span></p>

Jerusalem itself affords at this day a touching illustration of this passage. There is reason to believe that a considerable portion of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>lower </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>part </span>of the walls which enclose the present mosque of Omar, which occupies the site of the ancient Jewish temple, are the same, or at least the southern, western, and eastern sides are the same as those of Solomon&#39;s temple. At one part where the remains of this old wall are the most considerable and of the most massive character&#8212;where two courses of masonry, composed of massive blocks of stone, rising to the height of thirty feet&#8212;is what is called the Wailing Place of the Jews. &quot;Here,&quot; says Dr. Olin, &quot;at the foot of the wall, is an open place paved with flags, where the Jews assemble every Friday, and in small numbers on other days, for the purpose of praying and bewailing the desolations of their holy places. Neither the Jews nor Christians are allowed to enter the Haram, which is consecrated to Mohammedan worship, and this part of the wall is the nearest approach they can make to what they regard as the precise spot within the forbidden enclosure upon which the ancient temple stood. They keep the pavement swept with great care, and take off their shoes, as on holy ground. Standing or kneeling with their faces towards the ancient wall, they gaze in<a id='GBS.PA435.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.448.1.0.box.226.322.1293.312.q.50'>
silence upon its venerable stones, or pour forth their complaints in halfsuppressed, though audible tones. This, to me, was always a most affecting sight, and I repeated my visit to this interesting spot to enjoy and sympathise with the melancholy yet pleasing spectacle. The poor people sometimes sobbed aloud, and still found tears to pour out for the desolations of their &#39;beautiful house.&#39; &#39;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

But the building of Zion doth infinitely please him, because Zion is as the apple of his eye to him; he bought Zion at a dear rate, with his own blood ; he lays Zion in his bosom, he is ravished with Zion, Zion is his love, his dove, his fair one; he hath chosen Zion, and loves the gates of it, better than all the palaces of Jacob; and being so pleasing to bim, no marvel if he put on all his glorious apparel when he is to adorn and build up Zion. And, secondly, it is because all the glory that he looks for to eternity must arise out of this one work of building Zion ; this one work shall be the only monument of his glory to eternity: this goodly world, this heaven and earth, that you see and enjoy the use of, is set up only as a shop, as a workshop, to stand only for a week, for six or seven thousand years, (&quot;a thousand years is with the Lord but as a day&quot;); and when his work is done he will throw this piece of clay down again, and out of this he looks for no other glory than from a <span style='font-style:italic;'>eabul, </span>a land of dirt, or a shepherd&#39;s cottage, or a gourd which springs up in a night and withers in a day; but this piece he sets up for a higher end, to be the eternal mansion of his holiness and honour; this is his <span style='font-style:italic;'>metropolis, </span>his temple, his house<a id='GBS.PA436.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.449.1.0.box.264.319.1298.385.q.60'>
where his fire and furnace is, his court, his glorious high throne, and therefore his glory is much concerned in this work. When Nebuchadnezzar would have a city for the honour of his kingdom, and the glory of his majesty, he will make it a stately piece. Solomon made all his kingdom very rich and glorious, but he made his court, and especially his throne, another manner of thing, so stately that the like was not to be seen in any other kingdom; and therefore no wonder though he appear in his glory in building up of that, which we may boldly say must be one day made as glorious as his wisdom can contrive, and his power bring to pass.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Stephen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Marshall, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bight </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Honourable </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Rouse </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Peers, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>entitled </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;God&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Master</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>piece,&#39;</span>&quot; 1645.</span></p>

I. One is, because they well know that the Lord hath reserved nothing to himself but only his glory; the benefits he gives to them; all the sweetness and honey that can be found in them he gives them leave to suck out; but his glory and his praise is his own, and that which he hath wholly reserved; of that he is jealous, lest it should either be denied, eclipsed, diminished, or any the least violation offered to it in any kind. All God&#39;s people know this of him, and therefore they cannot but endeavour to preserve it for him. II. Secondly, besides, they know, as God is jealous in that point, so it is all the work that he hath appointed them to do; he hath therefore separated them to himself out of all nations of the world, to be his peculiar ones for this very end, that they might give him all the glory and praise of his mercy. &quot;I have( said God) <span style='font-style:italic;'>created </span>him, <span style='font-style:italic;'>formed, </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span>him <span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory.&quot; </span>Isai. xliii. 7. This is the law of his <span style='font-style:italic;'>new </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>creation, </span>which is as powerful in them as the law of <span style='font-style:italic;'>nature, </span>or the <span style='font-style:italic;'>first </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>creation, </span>is in the rest of his works. And therefore with a holy and spiritual naturalness (if I may so call it) the hearts of all the saints are carried to give God the glory, as really as the stones are carried to the centre, or the fire to fly upwards: this is fixed in their hearts, the work of grace hath moulded them to it, that they can do no other but endeavour to exalt God, it being the very end why their spiritual life and all their other privileges are conferred upon them.</p>

Yea, thirdly, they know their own interests are much concerned in God&#39;s glory, they never are losers by it: if in any work of God he want his praise, they will want their comfort; but if God be a gainer, they shall certainly be no losers. Whatever is poured upon the head of Christ&#8212;what ointment soever of praise or glory, it will in a due proportion fall down to the skirts of his garments; nor is there any other way to have any sweetness, comfort, praise, or glory to be derived unto themselves, but by giving all unto him to whom aloue it belongeth, and then although he will never give away his glory&#8212;the glory of being the <span style='font-style:italic;'>fountain, </span>the <span style='font-style:italic;'>first, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>supreme, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>original </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>giver </span>of all good ; yet they shall have the glory of instruments, and of fellow workers with him, which is a glory and praise sufficient.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Stephen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Marshall. </span></p>

He says of Christ, that he was &quot; put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit.&quot; He evidently distinguished of two natures, his divine and human, even as Rom. i. 3, 4 and elsewhere; and then declares how by that divine nature, which he terms &quot; Spirit,&quot; in which he was existent in Noah&#39;s times, he went and preached to those of the old world, whose souls are now in prison in hell. These words, &quot; in Spirit,&quot; are not put to signify the subject of vivification; for such neither his soul nor Godhead could be said to be, for that is not quickened which was not dead; but for the principal and cause of his vivification, which his soul was not, but his Godhead was. And besides by his Spirit is not meant his soul, for that then must be supposed to have preached to souls in hell (where these are affirmed to be). Now, there is no preaching where there is no capacity of faith. But his meaning is, that those persons that lived in Noah&#39;s time, and were preached unto, their souls and spirits were now, wheu this was written, spirits in prison, that is, iu hell. And therefore he also adds this word &quot;sometimes&quot;: who were sometimes disobedient in Noah&#39;s days.&quot; These words give us to understand that this preaching was performed&quot; by Noah ministerially, yet by Christ in Noah; who according to his divine person was extant, and went with him, as with Moses, and the church in the wilderness, and preached unto them.</p>

was the Word.&quot; In which words, there being no predicate or attribute affirmed of this word, the sentence or affirmation is terminated or ended merely with his existence: &quot;he was,&quot; and he was then, &quot;in the beginning.&quot; He says not that he was made in the beginning, but that &quot; he was in the beginning.&quot; And it is in the beginning absolutely, without any limitation. And therefore Moses&#39;s beginning, Gen. i. 1, is meant, as also the words after show, &quot;All was made by him that was made;&quot; and, ver. 10, the world he came into was made by him. And as from the beginning is usually taken from the first times or infancy of the world ; so then, when God began to create, then was our Christ. And this here is set in opposition (John i. 14) unto the time of his being made flesh, lest that should have been thought his beginning. And unto this accords that of Heb. i. 10, where, speaking of Christ, out of Psalm cii., <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>beginning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>l(iid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>foundations </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth;&#39;&#39; </span>so as to be sure he existed then.

So are the works of creation unto God, he so far makes them his garment or clothing as in them to give out some instances of his power and wisdom; but he is also hid in them, in that by them no creature can come 1o the full and perfect knowledge of him. Now, when thiswoik shall cease, and God shall unclothe or unveil all his glory to his saints, and they shall know him perfectly, see him as he is, so far as a created nature is capable of that comprehension, thenw-illhe lay them aside and fold them up, at least as to that use, as easily as a man lays aside a gaiment that he will wear or use no more.

Lord, begotten by them to God, as noting the perpetuity of the church, &#39;who shall in every age bring forth children to God. &#39;Tis the comfort of God&#39;s people to see a young brood growing up to continue his remembrance in the world, that when they die religion shall not die with them, nor the succession of the church be interrupted. This sense is not altogether incongruous; but rather I think the children of their body are here intended; it being a blessing often promised: see the next psalm, verse 17. &quot;The mercy of the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children&#39;s children.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;&#39;Shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>continue;&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>established.&quot; </span>In -what sense is it spoken?

And if it doth not always full out accordingly, yet for the most part it doth; and we are no competent judges of God&#39;s dispensations in this kind, because we see Providence by pieces, and have not the skill to set them together; but at the day of judgment, when the whole contexture of God&#39;s dealings is laid before us we shall clearly understand how <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>children </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servants </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>continue, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>seed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>established.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;Manton. </span></span></p>
