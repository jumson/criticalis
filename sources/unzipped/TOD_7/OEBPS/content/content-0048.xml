If we were so foolish as to make sure of concealment because the place was shrouded in midnight, we might well be alarmed out of our security by the fact that, as far as God is concerned, we always dwell in the light; for even the night itself glows with a revealing force,&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>night </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>light </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>about </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.</span>&quot; Let us think of this if ever we are tempted to take license from the dark&#8212;it is light about us.

Men cling to this notion, because it is easier and less expensive to hide under darkness than to journey to remote places; and therefore the foolish thought is here beaten to pieces by statements which in their varied forms effectually batter it. Yet the ungodly are still duped by their grovelling notions of God, and enquire, &quot;How doth God know?&quot; They must fancy that he is as limited in his powers of observation as they are, and yet if they would but consider for a moment they would conclude that he who could not see in the dark could not be God, and he who is not present everywhere could not be the Almighty Creator. Assuredly God is in all places, at all times, and nothing can by any possibility be kept away from his all-observing, all-comprehending mind. The Great Spirit comprehends within himself all time and space, and yet he is infinitely greater than these, or aught else that he has made.</p>

The word &quot; reins&quot; signifies the kidneys, which by the Hebrews were supposed to be the seat of the desires and longings; but perhaps it indicates here the most hidden and vital portion of the man; this God doth not only inspect, and visit, but it is his own; he is as much at home there as a landlord on his own estate, or a proprietor in his own house. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>covered </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mothers </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>womb.&#39;&#39; </span>There I lay hidden&#8212;covered by thee.

Thus the Psalmist describes the intimacy which God had with him. In his most secret part&#8212;his reins, and in his most secret condition&#8212;yet unborn, he was under the control and guardianship of God.</p>

Those who wish to praise have subjects for adoration ready to hand. \Ve too seldom remember our creation, and all the skill and kindness bestowed upon our frame: but the sweet siuger of Israel was better instructed, and therefore he prepares for the chief musician a sung concerning our nativity nnd all the fashioning which precedes it. We cannot begin too soon to bless our Maker, who began so soon to bless us: even in the act of creation he created reasons for our praising his name. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fearfully </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wonderfully </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made.&#39;&#39; </span>Who can gaze even upon a model of our anatomy without wonder aud awe? Who could dissect a portion of the human frame without marvelling at its delicacy, and trembling at its frailty? The Psalmist had scarcely peered within the veil which hides the nerves, sinews, and blood-vessels from common inspection; the science of anatomy was quite unknown to him ; and yet he had seen enough to arouse his admiration of the work and his reverence for the Worker. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Marvellous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works.</span>&quot; These parts of my frame are all <span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span>works; and though they be home works, close under my own eye, yet are they wonderful to the last degree. They are works within my own self, yet are they beyond my understanding, and appear to me as so many miracles of skill and power. We need not go to the ends of the earth for marvels, nor even across our own threshold ; they abound in our own bodies.</p>

He was made to know the marvellous nature of God&#39;s work with assurance and accuracy, for he had found by experience that the Lord is a masterworker, performing inimitable wonders when accomplishing his kind designs. If we are marvellously wrought upon even before we are born, what shall we say of the Lord&#39;s dealings with us after we quit his secret workshop, and he directs our pathway through the pilgrimage of life? What shall we not say of that new birth which is even more mysterious than the first, and exhibits even more the love and wisdom of the Lord.</p>

A great artist will often labour alone in his studio, and not suffer his work to be seen until it is finished; even so did the Lord fashion us where no eye beheld as, and the veil was not lifted till every member was complete. Much of the formation of our inner man still proceeds in secret: hence the more of solitude the better for us. The true church also is being fashioned in secret, so that none may cry, &quot;Lo, here!&quot; or &quot; Lo, there !&#39;&#39; as if that which is visible could ever be identical with the invisibly growing body of Christ. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>curiously </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wrought </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>law</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cxt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>parts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>&quot;Embroidered with great skill,&quot; is an accurate poetical description of the creation of veins, sinews, muscles, nerves, etc. What tapestry can equal the human fabric <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;I </span>This work is wrought as much in private as if it had been accomplished in the grave, or in the darkness of the abyss. The expressions are poetical, beautifully veiling, though not absolutely concealing, the real meaning. God&#39;s intimate knowledge of us from our beginning, and even before it, is here most charmingly set forth. Cannot he who made us thus wondrously when we were not, still carry on his work of power till he has perfected us, though we feel unable to aid in the process, and are lying in great sorrow and self-loathing, as though cast into the lowest parts of the earth?</p>

That we have eyes, and ears, and hands, and feet, is all due to the wise and gracious purpose of heaven : it was so ordered in the secret decree by which all things are as they are. God&#39;s purposes concern our limbs and faculties. Their form, and shape, and everything about them were appointed of God long before they had any existence. God saw us when we could not be seen, and he wrote about us when there was nothing of us to write about. When as yet there were none of our members in existence, all those members were before the eye of God in the sketch-book of his foreknowledge and predestination.</span></p>

Those of the elect who are as yet unborn, or unrenewed, are nevertheless written in the Lord&#39;s book. As the form of Eve grew up in silence and secrecy under the fashioning hand of the Maker, so at this hour is the Bride being fashioned for the Lord Jesus; or, to change the figure,&#8212;a body is being prepared in which the life and glory of the indwelling Lord shall for ever be displayed.

Even could we count the sands on the sea-shore, we should not then be able to number God&#39;s thoughts, for they are &quot;more in number than the sand.&quot; This is not the hyperbole of poetry, but the solid fact of inspired statement: God thinks upon us infinitely : there is a limit to the act of creation, but not to the might of divine love.</span></p>

Crimes committed before the face of the Judge are not likely to go unpunished. If the eye of God is grieved with the presence of evil, it is but natural to expect that he will remove the offending object. God who sees all evil will slay all evil. With earthly sovereigns sin may go unpunished for lack of evidence, or the law may be left without execution from lack of vigour in the judge ; but this cannot happen in the case of God, the living God. He beareth not the sword in vain. Such is his love of holiness and hatred of wrong, that he will carry on war to the death with those whose hearts and lives are wicked. God will not always suffer his lovely creation to be defaced and defiled by the presence of wickedness : if anything is sure, this is sure, that he will ease him of his adversaries. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Depart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>therefore, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bhxxly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men.&quot; </span>Men who delight in cruelty and war are not fit companions for those who walk with God.

You would destroy others, and therefore I want you not in my society. You will be destroyed yourselves, I desire you not in my service. Depart from me, for you depart from God.

When men speak against God they will be sure to speak against us, if they find it serve their turn; hence godless men are not the stuff out of which true friends can ever be made.

How can we do other than withdraw from every sort of association with them? What a wonder of sin it is that men should rail against so good a Being as the Lord our God! The impudence of tho-ie who talk wickedly is a singular fact, and it is the more singular when we reflect that the Lord against whom they speak is all around them, and lays to heart every dishonour which they render to his holy name. We ought not to wonder that men slander and deride us, for they do the same with the Most High God.</p>

Of this hatred he is not ashamed, but he sets it forth as a virtue to which he would have the Lord bear testimony. To love all men with benevolence is our duty; but to love any wicked man with complacency would be a crime. To hate a man for his own sake, or for any evil done to us, would be wrong; but to hate a man because he is the foe of all goodness and the enemy of all righteousness, is nothing more nor less than an obligation. The more we love God the more indignant shall we grow with those who refuse him their affection. &quot;If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha.&quot; Truly, &quot;jealousy is cruel as the grave.&quot; The loyal subject must not be friendly to the traitor. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grieved </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>those </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee?&quot; </span>He appeals to heaven that he took no pleasure in those who rebelled against the Lord ; but, on the contrary, he was made to mourn by a sight of their ill behaviour. Since God is everywhere, he knows our feelings towards the profane and ungodly, and &#39;he knows that so far from approving such characters the very sight of them is grievous to our eyes.</p>

He is graciously inclined towards us, and is willing to bend his omniscience to serve the end of our sanctification. Let us pray as David did, and let us be as honest as he. We cannot hide our sin: salvation lies the other way, in a plain discovery of evil, and an effectual severance from it.</span></p>

Divine truths look full as well when they are prayed over as when they are preached over: and much better than when they are disputed over. When we speak of God to him himself, we find ourselves concerned to speak with the utmost degree both of sincerity and reverence, which will be likely to make the impressions the deeper.

This is what we cannot comprehend; but it is what, according to the light of reason, must be true, and, according to revelation, is indeed true. God can do nothing imperfectly; and we may form some idea of his superintending knowledge, by conceiving what is indeed the truth, that all the powers of the Godhead are employed, and solely employed, in the observation and examination of the conduct of one individual. I say, this is indeed the case, because all the powers of the Godhead are employed upon the least as well as upon the greatest concerns of the universe; and the whole mind and power of the Creator are as exclusively employed upon the formation of a grub as of a world. God knows everything perfectly, and he knows everything perfectly at once. This, to a human understanding, would breed confusion; but there can be no confusion in the Divine understanding, because confusion arises from imperfection. Thus God, without confusion, beholds as distinctly the actions of every man, as if that man were the only created being, and the Godhead were solely employed in observing him. Let this thought fill your mind with awe and with remorse.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kirke </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>White, </span>1785&#8212;1806.</p>

By &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>lying </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot; </span>is signified to us the private and close actions of his life; such as were attended only by darkness and solitude. In Psal. xxxvi. verse 4, it is said of the wicked that &quot; he deviseth mischief upon his bed,&quot; to denote not only his perverse diligence, but also his secresy <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>it : and God is said to &quot;hide his children in the secret of his pavilion,&quot; so that these places of rest and lying down are designed for secresy and withdrawing. When a man retires into his chamber, he does in a manner, for a while, shut himself out of the world. And that this is the fine sense of that expression of <span style='font-style:italic;'>lying </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down </span>appears from the next words, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>acquainted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ways&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>j </span>where he collects in one word what he had before said in two; or, it may come in by way of entrance and deduction, from the former. As if he should say, Thou knowcst what I do in my ordinary converse with men, and also how I behave myself when I am retired from them; therefore thou knowest <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>my actions, since a man&#39;s actions may be reduced either to his public or private deportment. By the other expression of <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ways&quot; </span>is here meant the total of a man&#39;s behaviour before God, whether in thoughts, words, or deeds, as is manifest by comparing this with other verses.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>South. </span></p>

Either rendering amounts to the same thing, and it is of no consequence which we adopt. The idea meant to be conveyed is, that while the tongue is the index of thought to man, being the great medium of communication, God, who knows the heart, is independent of words.

Some of you feel at times that you can scarcely say a word, and the less you say the better. Well, it way be as well; for great talkers are almost sure to make slips with their tongue. It may be a good thing that you cannot speak much; for in the multitude of words there lacketh not sin. Wherever you go, what light, vain, and foolish conversations you hear! I am glad not to be thrown into circumstances where I can hear it. But with you it may be different. You may often repent of speaking, you will rarely repent of silence.

He observes, not only the complicated system of the universe, but the slightest motion of the most microscopic insect ;&#8212;not only the sublimest conception of angels, but the meanest propensity of the most worthless of his creatures. At this moment he is listening to the praises breathed by grateful hearts in distant worlds, and reading every grovelling thought which passes though the polluted minds of the fallen race of Adam. ... At one view, he surveys the past, the present, and the future. No inattention prevents him from observing; no defect of memory or of judgment obscures his comprehension. In his remembrance are stored not only the transactions of this world, but of all the worlds in the universe ;&#8212;not only the events of the six thousand years which have passed since the earth was created, but of a duration without beginning. Nay, things to come, extending to a duration without end, are also before him. An eternity past and an eternity to come are, at the same moment, in his eye ; and with that eternal eye he surveys infinity. How amazing!

As God is a simple spirit, without dimensions, parts, or susceptibility of division, he is equally, that is, fully, present at all times in all places. At any given moment he is not present partly here and partly in the utmost skirt of the furthest system which revolves about the dimmest telescopic star, as if like a galaxy of perfection he stretched a sublime magnificence through universal space, which admitted of separation and partition; but he is present, with the totality of his glorious properties in every point of space. This results undeniably from the simple spirituality of the Great Supreme. All that God is in one place he is in all places. All there is of God is in every place. Indeed, his presence has no dependence on space or matter. His attribute of essential presence were the same if universal matter were blotted out. Only by a figure can God be said to be in the universe; for the universe is comprehended by him. All the boundless glory of the Godhead is essentially present at every spot in his creation, however various may be the manifestations of this glory at different times and places.</p>

For my part, I cannot doubt that we are to understand certain beautiful light clouds as thus poetically described. I have observed invariably, that in the late spring-time, in summer, and yet more especially in the autumn, white clouds are to be seen in Palestine. They only occur at the earliest hours of morning, just previous to and at the time of sunrise. It is the total absence of clouds at all other parts of the day, except during the short period of the winter rains, that lends such striking solemnity and force to those descriptions of the Second Advent where our Lord is represented as coming in the clouds. This feature of his majesty loses all its meaning in lands like ours, in which clouds are of such common occurrence that they are rarely absent from the sky. The morning clouds of summer and autumn are always of a brilliant silvery white, save at such times as they are dyed with the delicate opal tints of dawn. They hang low upon the mountains of Judah, and produce effects of undescribable beauty, as they float far down in the valleys, or rise to wrap themselves around the summit of the hills. In almost every instance, by about seven o&#39;clock the heat has dissipated these fleecy clouds, and to the vivid Eastern imagination morn has folded her outstretched wings.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Neil. </span></p>
