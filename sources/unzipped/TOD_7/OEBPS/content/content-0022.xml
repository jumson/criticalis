He is far from thinking that the care and human labour, which is employed in the buildinsr of houses and keeping of cities, is to be regarded as useless, because the Lord builds and keeps; since it is then the more especially useful and effectual when the Lord himself is the builder and keeper.

Our prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence in our favour. To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity. And have we now forgotten this powerful Friend? or do wo imagine we no longer need his assistance? I have lived for a long time [81 years&#39;] ; and the longer I live the more convincing proofs 1 see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of man. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings, that &quot;Except the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>build the house, they labour in vain that build it.&quot; I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall proceed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel: we shall be divided by our little, partial, local interests; our prospects will be confounded; and we ourselves shall become a reproach and a by-word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter, from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing government by human wisdom, and leave it to chance, war, or conquest. I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers, imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessing on our deliberations, be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business; and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Benjamin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Franklin</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Speech </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Convention </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forming </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Constitution </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>United </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>States, </span>1787.</p>

The phrases in the Hebrew are &quot; making early to rise&quot; and &quot; making late to sit&quot; &#8212;not &quot; up,&quot; but <span style='font-style:italic;'>down. </span>This means an artificial lengthening of the day. Thelaw of work is in our nature. The limitations of effort are set forth in nature. In order that all may be accomplished by the human race which is necessary to be done for human progress, all men must work. But no man should work beyond his physical and intellectual ability, nor beyond the hours which nature allots. No net result of good to the individual or to the race comes of any artificial prolonging of the day at either end. Early rising, eating one&#39;s breakfast by candlelight, and prolonged vigils, the scholar&#39;s &quot;midnight oil,&quot; are a delusion and a snare. Work while it is day. When the night comes, rest. The other animals do this, and, as races, fare as well as this anxious human race.</p>

The meaning is, that though worldly men fare never so hardly, beat their brains, tire their spirits, rack their consciences, yet many times all is for nothing; either God doth not give them an estate, or not the comfort of it. But his beloved, without any of these racking cares, enjoy contentment; if they have not the world, they have sleep and rest; with silence submitting to the will of God, and with quietness waiting for the blessing of God.

Around its massive walls there ran a <br/>deep moat. Watchmen paced the walls both day and night. It was a fine old <br/>fortress, bidding defiance to the foe; but I was not happy in it. I thought I lay <br/>upon a couch; but scarcely had I closed my eyes, ere a trumpet blew, &quot; To arms I <br/>To arms!&quot; and when the danger was overpast, I lay me down again. &quot;To <br/>arms! To arms I&quot; once more resounded, and again I started up. Never could <br/>I rest. I thought I had my armour on, and moved about perpetually clad in <br/>mail, rushing each hour to the castle top, aroused by some fresh alarm. At one <br/>time a foe was coming from tue west; at another from the east. I thought I had <br/>a treasure somewhere down in some deep part of the castle, and all my care was <br/>to guard it. I dreaded, I feared, I trembled lest it should be taken from me. I <br/>awoke, and I thought I would not live in such a tower as that for all its grandeur. <br/>It was the castle of discontent, the castle of ambition, in which man never rests. <br/>It is ever, &quot;To arms! To arms!&quot; There is a foe here, or a foe there. His <br/>dear-loved treasure must be guarded. Sleep never crossed the drawbridge of the <br/>castle of discontent. Then I thought I would supplement it by another reverie. <br/>I was in a cottage. It was in what poets call a beautiful and pleasant place, but <br/>I cared not for that. I had no treasure in the world, save one sparkling jewel on <br/>my brpast: and I thought I put my hand on that and went to sleep, nor did I <br/>wake till morning light. That treasure was a quiet conscience and the love of <br/>God&#8212;&quot;the peace that pasaeth all understanding.&quot; I slept, because I slept in <br/>the house of content, satisfied with what I had.

It is also as certain that he speaks of children as supposed to be holy and godly ; for otherwise they are not a reward, but a curse, and a sorrow to him that begat them. The psalm was made, as appears by the title of it, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>or </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Solomon,&quot; </span>and therefore, as it is more than probable, was penned, as that other psalm, the 72nd, which bears the same title, by David the father, of and for Solomon his son, who was, for his father&#39;s sake, &quot;the beloved of God&quot; (2 Sam. xii. 24, 25), and upon whom the sure covenant and mercies of David were entailed, together with his kingdom. And what is said in this psalm, in the verses before, fitly agrees to him, for he it was who was to build God&#39;s house, to keep and preserve Jerusalem the city, and the kingdom in peace, and to have rest, or as the Psalmist calls it (verse 3), quiet sleep given him by God, from all his enemies round about him. And for this, compare the prophecy of him (1 Chron. xxii. 9, 10) with the instructions here given him in the three first verses of this psalm, and ye will see how -fitly this psalm concerns him.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

To have many children is the next blessing to much grace. To have many children about us is better than to have much wealth about us. To have store of these olive plants (as the Psalmist calls them) round about our table is better than to have store of oil and wine upon our table. We know the worth of dead, or rather lifeless treasures, but who knows the worth of living treasures? Every man who hath children hath not a blessing in them, yet children are a blessing, and some have many blessings in one child. Children are chiefly a blessing to the children of God. &quot;Zo, <span style='font-style:italic;'>children </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heritage </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>: <span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fruit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>womb </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reward.&quot; </span>But are not houses and lands, gold and silver, an heritage bestowed by the Lord upon his people?

Yes! but will God be neglectful of his own heritage? will he turn a gift into a sorrow? Poor as thou art, repine not at the number of thy children. Though lions lack thou shalt not, if thou seekest him; and know that it may be even for their sakes that he feedeth thee.
