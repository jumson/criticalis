It is well when the Lord&#39;s royalty arouses our loyalty, and our spirit is moved to magnify his majesty. The Psalmist has extolled his Lord many a time before, he is doing so still, and he will do so in the future: praise is for all tenses. When we cannot express all our praise just now, it is wise to register our resolution to continue in the blessed work, and write it down as a bond, &quot;I will extol thee.&quot; See how David testifies his devotion and adherence to his God by the pronoun &quot; my,&quot; how he owns his allegiance by the title &quot; king,&quot; and how he goes on to declare his determination to make much of him in his song.</p>

&quot;bless&quot; not merely for variation of sound, but also for the deepening and sweetening of the sense. To bless God is to praise him with a personal affection for him, and a wishing well to him : this is a growingly easy exercise as we advance in experience and grow in grace. David declares that he will offer every form of praise, through every form of existence. His notion of duration is a full one&#8212; &quot;for ever&quot; has no end, but when he adds another &quot; ever&quot; to it he forbids all idea of a close. Our praise of God shall be as eternal as the God we praise.</span></p>

Were we well to consider the matter we should see abundant cause in each day for rendering special blessing unto the Lord. All before the day, all in the day, all following the day should constrain us to magnify our God every day, all the year round. Our love to God is not a matter of holy days: every day is alike holy to holy men. David here comes closer to God than when he said, &quot;I will bless thy name&quot; : it is now, &quot;I will bless <span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&quot; </span>This is the centre and kernel of true devotion : we do not only admire the Lord&#39;s words and works, but himself. Without realizing the personality of God, praise is well-nigh impossible; you cannot extol an abstraction. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span>ewr.&quot; He said he would bless that name, and now he vows to praise it; he will extol the Lord in every sense and way. Eternal worship shall not be without its variations; it will never become monotonous. Heavenly music is not harping upon one string, but all strings shall be tuned to one praise. Observe the personal pronouns here: four times he says &quot;/will &quot; : praise is not to be discharged by proxy : there must be your very self in it, or there is nothing in it.</p>

There is no part of Jehovah&#39;s greatness which is not worthy of great praise. In some beings greatness is but vastness of evil: in him it is magnificence of goodness. Praise may be said to be great when the song contains great matter, when the hearts producing it are intensely fervent, and when large numbers unite in the grand acclaim. No chorus is too loud, no orchestra too large, no psalm too lofty for the lauding of the Lord of Hosts.</p>

Yet when we meditate most, and search most studiously we shall still find ourselves surrounded with unknowable wonders, which will baffle all attempts to sing them worthily. The best adoration of the Unsearchable is to own him to be so, and close the eyes in reverence before the excessive light of his glory. Not all the minds of all the centuries shall suffice to search out the unsearchable riches of God ; he is past finding out; and, therefore, his deserved praise is still above and beyond all that we can render to him.</p>

Everything which bus to do with the Great King is majestic, honourable, glorious. His least is greater than man&#39;s greatest, his lowest is higher than man&#39;s highest. There is nothing about the infinite Lord which is unworthy of his royalty; and, on the other hand, nothing is wanting to the splendour of his reign: his majesty is honourable, and his honour is glorious: he is altogether wonderful.</p>

Many works of power, of justice, of wisdom, are wonderful; and his work of grace is wondrous above all.

These things must not be permitted to pass away in silence; if others ao not remember them, representative men like David must make a point of conversing upon them in private, and speaking of them in public.

They sing of that righteousness which is the sinner&#39;s terror, which even good men mention with deep solemnity. Righteousness received by gospel light is in reality the secret foundation of the believer&#39;s hope. God&#39;s covenant of grace is our strong consolation, because he who made it is righteous, and will not run back from it. Since Jesus died as our substitute, righteousness requires and secures the salvation of all the redeemed. This attribute is our best friend, and therefore we sing of it.</p>

Few men will shout for joy at the righteousness of Jehovah, but those who do so are his chosen, in whom his soul delighteth.</p>

Is not this Jehovah&#39;s glory? To all living men this is his aspect: he is gracious, or full of goodness and generosity. He treats bis creatures with kindness, his subjects with consideration, and his saints with favour. His words and ways, his promises and his gifts, his plans and his purposes all manifest his grace, or free favour. There is nothing suspicious, prejudiced, morose, tyrannical, or unapproachable in Jehovah,&#8212;he is condescending and kind. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>full </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>compassion.&quot; </span>To the suffering, the weak, the foolish, the despondent, he is very pitiful: he feels for them, he feels with them : he does this heartily, and in a practical manner. Of this pitifulness he is full, so that he compassionates freely, constantly, deeply, divinely, and effectually. In God is fulness in a sense not known among men, and this fulness is all fragrant with sympathy for human misery. If the Lord be full of compassion there is no room in him for forgetfulness or harshness, and none should suspect him thereof. What an ocean of compassion there must be since the Infinite God is full of it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Slow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anger.&#39;&#39; </span>Even those who refuse his grace yet share in long-suffering.

Kindness is a law of God&#39;s universe: the world was planned for happiness; even now that sin has so sadly marred God&#39;s handiwork, and introduced elements which were not from the beginning, the Lord has so arranged matters that the fall is broken, the curse is met by an antidote, and the inevitable pain is softened with mitigations. Even in this sinstricken world, under its disordered economy, there are abundant traces of a hand skilful to soothe distress and heal disease. That which makes life bearable is the tenderness of the great Father. This is seen in the creation of an insect as well as in the ruling of nations. The Creator is never rough, the Provider is never forgetful, the Ruler is never cruel. Nothing is done to create disease, no organs are arranged to promote misery; the incoming of sickness and pain is not according to the original design, but a result of our disordered state. Man&#39;s body as it left the Maker&#39;s hand was neither framed for disease, decay, nor death, neither was the purpose of it discomfort and anguish ; far otherwise, it was framed for a joyful activity, and a peaceful enjoyment of God. Jehovah has in great consideration laid up in the world cures for our ailments, and helps for our feebleness; and if many of these have been long in their discovery, it is because it was more for man&#39;s benefit to find them out himself, than to have them labelled and placed in order before his eyes. We may be sure of this, that Jehovah has never taken delight in the ills of his creatures, but has sought their good, and laid himself out to alleviate the distresses into which they have guiltily plunged themselves.</p>

The skill, kindness, and power manifested in the formation of each living thing is in itself to the praise of God, and when observed by an intelligent mind the Lord is honoured thereby.

None but blessed men will bless the Lord. Only saints or holy ones will bless the thrice holy God. If we praise Jehovah because of his works around us, we must go on to bless him for his works within us. Let the two &quot; shalls&quot; of this verse be fulfilled, especially the latter one.</p>

minds. Those who bless God from their hearts rejoice to see him enthroned, glorified, and magnified in power. No subject is more profitable for humility, obedience, hope, and joy than that of the reigning power of the Lord our God. Ili. works praise him, but they cannot crown him : this remains for holy hands and hearts. It is their high pleasure to tell of the glory of his kingdom in its justice, kindness, eternity, and so forth. Kingdoms of earth are glorious for riches, for extent of territory, for victories, for liberty, for commerce, and other matters; but in ull true glories the kingdom of Jehovah excels them.

Apart from him the laws of nature would be inoperative. His power is the one source of force&#8212;mechanical, vital, mental, spiritual. Beyond the power of God which has been put forth, infinite force lies latent in himself. Who can calculate the reserve forces of the Infinite? How, then, can his kingdom fail? We hear talk of the five great powers, but what are they to the One Great Power? The Lord is &quot; the blessed and only Potentate.&quot; Let us accustom ourselves to think more deeply and speak more largely of this power which ever makes for righteousness and works for mercy.</span></p>

As the State cannot teach these holy histories the people of God must take care to do it themselves. The work must be done for every age, for men have short memories in reference to their God, and the doings of his power. They inscribe the deeds of their heroes upon brass, but the glorious acts of Jehovah are written upon the sand, and the tide of time washes them from present memory; therefore we must repeat the lesson, and yet again repeat it. The saints are the religious instructors of the race; they ought to be not only the historians of the past, but the bards of the present, whose duty it is to keep the sons of men in memory of the great deeds which the Lord did in the days of their fathers and in the old time before them. Note the contrast between the great deeds of God and the puny sons of Adam, who have even degenerated from their father, though he was as nothing compared with his Maker.</p>

It is, according to these verses, a kingdom of glory and power; a kingdom of light which men are to know, and of might which men are to feel; it is full of majesty and eternity; it is the benediction of every generation. We are to speak of it, talk of it, and make it known, and then we are to acknowledge it in the homage directed. distinctly to the Lord himself&#8212;as in verse thirteen.</p>

The form of the verb shows that he is always doing this; he is Jehovah upholding. His choice of the fallen, and the falling, as the subjects of his gracious help is specially to be noted. The fallen of our race, especially fallen women, are shunned by us, and it is peculiar tenderness on the Lord&#39;s purt that such he looks upon, even those who are at once the chief of sinners and the least regarded of mankind. The falling ones among us are too apt to be pushed down by the strong: their timidity and dependence make them the victims of the proud and domineering. To them also the Lord gives his upholding help. The Lord loves to reverse things, &#8212;he puts down the lofty, and lifts up the lowly.</p>

Many are despondent, and cannot lift up their heads in courage, or their hearts with comfort; but these he cheers. Some are bent with their daily load, and these he strengthens. Jesus loosed a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had so bound that she was bowed down, and could by no means lift up herself. In this he proved himself to be the true Son of the Highest. Think of the Infinite b6wing to lift up the bowed, and stooping to be leaned upon by those who are ready to fall. The two &quot; alls&quot; should not be overlooked: the Lord has a kindly heart towards the whole company of the afflicted.</p>

As children look to a father for all they need, so do the creatures look to God, the all-sufficient Provider.

The thought of this brings God so near to our poet-prophet that he is again speaking with God after the style of thee and thou. Is it to be wondered at when the Lord is feeding the hungry all around us,&#8212;giving food to all creatures, and to ourselves among them? Like a flock of sheep the creatures stand around the Lord as their great Shepherd ; all eyes are to his hand expecting to receive their food ; nor are they disappointed, for when the hour comes suitable provender is ready for each creature. Observe the punctuality of the Lord in giving food at meal-time,&#8212;in the season when it is due. This he does for all, and each living thing has its own season, so that the Lord of heaven is feeding his great flock both by day and by night, during every moment of i</p>

Thou doest it liberally, with open hand; thou doest it easily, as if it were only to open thine hand ; thou doest this at once as promptly as if all supplies were ready to hand. Living things have needs, and these create desires; the living God has suitable supplies at hand, and these he gives till inward satisfaction is produced, and the creature sighs no longer. In spiritual things, when God has raised a desire, he always gratifies it; hence the longing is prophetic of the blessing. In no case is the desire of the living thing excited to produce distress, but in order that it may seek and find satisfaction.</p>

Even the rude, gross, material earth, which we were created to subdue, and upon which we so proudly tread, is represented as having to the palpable sense this advantage over us.

They must be hia;h, and vehement, fervent, flaming, zealous and affectionate, full of life and vigour; our spirits must be raised, our hearts and tongues enlarged in the performance of this duty. God&#39;s glorious name, as it is in Nehem. ix. 5, &quot;is exalted above all blessing and praise,&quot; above our devoutest and most zealous praises; and therefore surely faint, heartless, and lifeless praises are so far from reaching him, as that they may seem to be meant of another, and a lower object. God then is not praised at all if he be not greatly praised.

Ask of ocean&#39;s waters; and the roar of their boundless waves shall chant from shore to shore a hymn of ascription to that Being, who hath said, &quot;Hitherto shall ye come and no further.&quot; Ask of the rivers; and, as they roll onward to the sea, do they not bear along their ceaseless tribute to the ever-working Energy, which struck open their fountains and poured them down through the valleys? Ask of every region of the earth, from the burning equator to the icy pole, from the rock-bound coast to the plain covered with its luxuriant vegetation; and will you not find on them all the record of the Creator&#39;s presence? Ask of the countless tribes of plants and animals; and shall they not testify to the action of the great Source of Life? Yes, from every portion, from every department of nature, comes the same voice; everywhere we hear thy name, O God ! everywhere we see thy love! Creation, in all its length and breadth, in all its depth and height, is the manifestation of thy Spirit, and without thce the world were dark and dead. The universe is to us as the burning bush which the Hebrew leader saw : God is ever present in it, for it burns with his glory, and the ground on which we stand is always holy.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Francis&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(Viscount </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dillon). </span></p>

Yonder deep and booming sea rolls up in storm and tempest, sweeping everything before it; and every dash of its waves praises God. The birds in the morning, and some of them all through the night, can never cease from praising; uniting with the ten thousand other voices which make ceaseless concert before the throne. But observe, neither the flower,*nor the sea, nor the bird, praises with intent to praise. To them it is no exercise of intellect, for they do not know God, and cannot understand his worthiness; nor do they even know that they are praising him. They exhibit his skill, and his goodness, and so forth, and in so doing they do much ; but we must learn to do more. When you and I praise God, there is the element of will, of intelligence, of desire, of intent; and in the saints of God there is another element, namely, that of love to him, of reverent gratitude towards him, and this turns the praise into blessing. A man is an eminent painter, and you exclaim, &quot;His pencil is instinct with life.&quot; Still, the m,m is no friend of yours, you pronounce no blessings on his nnme. It may be that your feeling towards him is that of deep regret that such abilities should be united with so ill a character. A certain person is exceedingly skilful in his profession, but he treats you unjustly, and, therefore, though you often praise him for his extraordinary performances, you cannot bless him, for you have no cause to do so. I am afraid that there might be such a feeling as that of admiration of God for his great skill, his wonderful power, his extraordinary justness, and yet no warmth of love in the heart towards him ; but in the saints the praise is sweetened with love, and is full of blessing. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>II. </span>5.</p>

And if creatures without life and reason should provoke mankind in general, as having life and reason, to praise God ; how much more should godly men be provoked by them to sing his praise, they having not only life, which stars have not ; and reason, which birds and beasts have not; but grace, which the most of men have not! Among visible creatures, men have most reason (because they have reason) to praise God; and among men gracious men have most reason to praise God, because they have grace.

The power of a kingdom consists in the number of its subjects, and the sufficiency of its revenues to maintain them. Now, the glory, or the power of God&#39;s kingdom, may be inferred from the difference between it and that of man. There are four points of difference. First, the kings of this world have but <span style='font-style:italic;'>few </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>suhjects, </span>with but little wealth,&#8212;not more than the population and riches of one kingdom, or one province, while God reigns over all angels, all men, all demons; and all wealth on land, in the sea, or in the air, belongs to him. There is another difference, that while the kings of this world rule their subjects, they arc still ruled by them, they are <span style='font-style:italic;'>dependent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than, </span>could do nothing without them; and, however abundant their revenues may be, they are generally in want, nay, even in debt, and, consequently, always calling for fresh tributes and taxes; but God, while he governs all, is subject to none, because he needs nobody&#39;s help or assistance. Instead of being in want, he abounds in everything, because he could, in one moment, bring from nothing much more</p>
