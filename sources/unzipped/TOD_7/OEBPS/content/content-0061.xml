He knew that Jehovah did hear prayer, and therefore he entreated him to hear his supplication, however feeble and broken it might be. In two forms he implores the one blessing of gracious audience :&#8212;&quot; hear&quot; and &quot;give ear.&quot; Gracious men are so eager to be heard in prayer that they double their entreaties for that boon. The Psalmist desires to be heard and to be considered; hence he cries, &quot;hear,&quot; and then &quot;give ear.&quot; Our case is difficult, and we plead for special attention. Here it is probable that David wished his suit against his adversaries to be heard by the righteous Judge; confident that if he had a hearing in the matter whereof he was slanderously accused, he would be triumphantly acquitted. Yet while somewhat inclined thus to lay his case before the Court of King&#39;s Bench, he prefers rather to turn it all into a petition, and<a id='GBS.PA307.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.326.1.0.box.209.260.1301.213.q.60'>
present it before the Court of Requests, hence he cries rather &quot; hear my prayer&quot; than &quot;hear my suit.&quot; Indeed David is specially earnest that he himself, and the whole of his life, may not become the subject of trial, for in that event he could not hope for acquittal. Observe that he offered so much pleading that his life became one continual <span style='font-style:italic;'>prayer</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>but that petitioning was so varied in form that it broke out in many <span style='font-style:italic;'>supplications. </span></span></p>

It is a happy thing when we dare appeal even to righteousness for our deliverance; and this we can do upon gospel principles, for &quot; if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.&quot; Even the sterner attributes of God are upon the side of the man who humbly trusts, and turns his trust into prayer. It is a sign of our safety when our interests and those of righteousness are blended. With God&#39;s faithfulness and righteousness upon our side we are guarded on the right hand and on the left. These are active attributes, and fully equal to the answering of any prayer which it would be right to answer. Requests which do not appeal to either of these attributes it would not be for the glory of God to hear, for they must contain desires for things unpromised, and unrighteous.</p>

Though clear before men, he could not claim innocence before God. Even though he knew himself to be the Lord&#39;s servant, yet he did not claim perfection, or plead merit; for even as a servant he was unprofitable. If such be the humble cry of <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;.&#39;. </span>servant, what ought to be the pleading of a sinner? <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sight </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>living^ </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>justified.&#39;&#39; </span>None can stand before God upon the footing of the law. God&#39;s sight is piercing and discriminating; the slightest flaw is seen and judged; and therefore pretence and profession cannot avail where that glance reads all the secrets of the soul. In this verse David told out the doctrine of universal condemnation by the law long before Paul had taken his pen to write the same truth. To this day it stands true even to the same extent as in David&#39;s day: no man living even at this moment may dare to present himself for trisl before the throne of the Great King on the footing of the law. This foolish age has produced specimens of a pride so rank that men have dared to claim perfection in the flesh; but these vain-glorious boasters are no exception to the rule here laid down: they are but men, and poor specimens of men. When their lives are examined they are frequently found to be more faulty than the humble penitents before whom they vaunt their superiority.</p>

Good men began to forget him, as though he had been long dead; and bad men made ridicule of his rueful visage as though it belonged not to a living man, but was dark with the shadow of the sepulchre.

He felt perplexed and overturned, lonely and afflicted. He was a man of thought and feeling, and suffered both in spirit and in heart from the undeserved and unprovoked hostility of his persecutors. Moreover, he laboured under the sense of fearful loneliness; he was for a while forsaken of his God, and his soul was exceeding heavy, even unto death. Such words our Lord Jesus might have used: in this the Head is like the members, and the members are as the Head.</p>

We once had merry days, days of deliverance, and joy and thanksgiving; why not again? Jehovah rescued his people in the ages which lie back, centuries ago; why should he not do the like again? We ourselves have a rich past to look back upon ; we have sunny memories, sacred memories, satisfactory memories, and these are as flowers for the bees of faith to visit, from whence they may make honey for present use. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>meditate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works.&#39;&#39; </span>When my own works reproach me, thy works refresh me.

Creation had been the book in which he read of the wisdom and goodness of the Lord. He repeats his perusal of the page of nature, and counts it a balm for his wounds, a cordial for his cares, to see what the Lord has made by his skilful hands. When the work of our own hand grieves us, let us look to the work of God&#39;s hands. Memory, meditation, and musing are here set together as the three graces, ministering grace to a mind depressed and likely to be diseased. As David with his harp played away the evil spirit from Saul, so does he here chase away gloom from his own soul by holy communion with God.</p>

No heavenly shower had refreshed him from the sanctuary: banished from the means of grace, his soul felt parched and dry, and he cried out, &quot;My soul to thee &quot; ; nothing would content him but the presence of his God. Not alone did he extend his hands, but his heart was stretched out towards the Lord. He was athirst for the Lord. If he could but feel the presence of his God he would no longer be overwhelmed or dwell in darkness; nay, everything would turn to peace and joy.</p>

The afflicted suppliant faints, and is ready to die. His life is ebbing out; each moment is of importance; it will soon be all over with him. No argument for speed can be more powerful than this. Who will not run to help a suppliant when his life is in jeopardy? Mercy has wings to its heels when misery is in extremity.

God&#39;s withdrawals reduce the heart to despair, and take away all strength from the mind. Moreover, his absence enables adversaries to work their will without restraint; and thus, in a second way, the persecuted one is like to perish. If we have God&#39;s countenance we live, but if he turns his back upon us we die. When the Lord looks with favour upon our efforts we prosper, but if he refuses to countenance them we labour in vain.</p>

A. sense of divine love is to the soul both dawn and dew ; the end of the night of weeping, the beginning of the morning of joy. Only God can take away from our weary ears the din of our care, and charm them with the sweet notes of his love. Our plea with the Lord is our faith: if we are relying upon him, he cannot disappoint us: &quot;in thee do I trust&quot; is a sound and solid argument with God. He who made the ear will cause us to hear: he who is love itself will have the kindness to bring his lovingkindness before <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Out </span>minds. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Cause </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>way </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wherein </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>should </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walk </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lift </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.</span>&#39;&#39; The Great First Cause must cause us to hear and to know. Spiritual senses are dependent upon God, and heavenly knowledge comes from him alone. To know the way we ought to take is exceedingly needful, for how can we be exact in obedience to a law with which we are not acquainted? or how can there be an ignorant holiness? If we know not the way, how shall we keep in it? If we know not wherein we should walk, how shall we be likely to follow the right path? The Psalmist lifts up his soul : faith is good at a dead lift: the soul that trusts will rise. We will not allow our hope to sink, but we will strive to get up and rise out of our daily griefs. This is wise. When David was in any difficulty as to his way he lifted his soul towards God himself, and then he knew that he could not go very far wrong. If the soul will not rise of itself we must lift it, lift it up unto God. This is good argument in prayer: surely the God to whom we endeavour to lift up our soul will condescend to show us what he would have us to do. Let us attend to David&#39;s example, and when our heart is low, let us heartily endeavour to lift it up, not so much to comfort as to the Lord himself.</p>

is our hiding-place; Jesus has made himself the refuge of his people: the sooner, and the more entirely we flee to him the better for us. Beneath the crimson canopy of our Lord&#39;s atonement believers are completely hidden ; let us abide there and be at rest. In the seventh verse our poet cried, &quot;Hide not thy face,&quot; and here he prays, &quot;Hide me.&quot; Note also how often he uses the words &quot; unto thee&quot; ; he is after his God; he must travel in that direction by some means, even though he may seem to be beating a retreat; his whole being longs to be near the Lord. Is it possible that such thirstings for God will be left unsupplied? Never, while the Lord is love.</span></p>

God could bring him out of it, and especially he could at once lift up his soul or spirit out of the ditch. The prayer is an eager one, and the appeal a bold one. We may be sure that trouble was soon over when the Lord heard such supplications.</p>

What did I find was her only stay, and hope, and comfort in the view of the dark valley of the shadow of death, which was drawing down upon her?

are inflicted upon me I would bear them without complaining, and never make my moan to thee about them; but they are the three greatest miseries that can be thought of; the greatest persecution, the greatest overthrow, and the greatest captivity. For what persecution so grievous .as to be persecuted in my soul? for he plays no less a game than for souls: he casts indeed at the body sometimes, and sometimes at goods, yet these are but the bye; the main of his aim is at the floul; for if he can otherwise win the soul he cares not much for either body or goods, but rather makes use of them to keep men in security; for whatsoever he doth, whatsoever he leaves undone, it is all done but in persecution of the soul; and he can persecute as well with prosperity as with adversity, and knows how to fit their several application. It seems as if he takes me for another Job; he sees he can do no good upon me with fawning and clawing, and therefore falls now to quarrelling and striking; and he strikes no light blows; for &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stricken </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>life </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ground </span>&quot;; and lower would have struck it, if thou, God, hadst not broken his blow. He strikes me downward, to keep me from heaven, as much as he can : and now that he sees me down, he lets not me rest so neither; but seizeth upon me, and being himself the prince of darkness, hath kept me in darkness; not for a night or two, as men stay at their inn, but for a much longer time, as at their dwelling; and it is no ordinary darkness that he hath made me to dwell in, but even the darkness of dead men; and that in the highest degree, as those that have been long dead. They that have been dead but a while are yet remembered sometimes, and sometimes talked of; but they that have been long dead are as quite forgotten as if they had never been; and such, alas, am I. So long have I been made to dwell in darkness, as if I had been dead many years ago, that he that would seek to find me out must be fain to look for me amongst the tombs and monuments. Indeed, to dwell in darkness is no better than the house of death: for as long as we are in life, if we want sometimes the light of the sun, yet the light of a candle will serve to supply it; but I, alas, am kept in such darkness that neither the sunshine of thy gospel nor the lantern of thy law gives any light unto me. I cannot with confidence say, as once I did, &quot; Thou, O Lord, shalt light my candle for me&quot; ; and as a body being dead grows cold and stiff, and is not to be bowed, so my soul with continuance in sinning is grown hardened, and, as it were, stiff in sin ; that it is as hard a matter to make me flexible to any goodness as to bring a body long dead to life again.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Sir </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Baker. </span></span></p>

This is its native air: God as the Environment of the soul has been from the remotest age the doctrine of all the deepest thinkers in religion. How profoundly Flebrew poetry is saturated with this high thought will appear when we try to conceive of it with this left out. True poetry is only science in another form. And long before it was possible for religion to give scientific expression to its greatest truths, men of insight uttered themselves in psalms which could not have been truer to Nature had the most modern light controlled the inspiration. &quot;As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.&quot; What fine sense of the natural analogy of the natural and spiritual does not underlie these words. As the hart after its environment, so man after his; as the water-brooks are fitly designed to meet the natural wants, so fitly does God implement the spiritual need of man. It will be noticed that in the Hebrew poets the longing for God never strikes one as morbid, or unnatural to the men who uttered it. It is as natural for them to long for God as for the swallow to seek her nest. Throughout all their images no suspicion rises within us that they are exaggerating. We feel how truly they are reading themselves, their deepest selves. No false note occurs in all their aspiration. There is no weariness even in their ceaseless sighing, except the lover&#39;s weariness for the absent&#8212;if they would fly away, it is only to be at rest. Men who have no soul can only wonder at this. Men who have a soul, but with little faith, can only envy it. How joyous a thing it was to the Hebrews to seek their God! How artlessly they call upon him to entertain them in his pavilion, to cover them with his feathers, to hide them in his secret place, to hold them in the hollow of his hand, or stretch around them the everlasting arms! These men were true children of nature. As the humming-bird among its own palm-trees, as the ephemera in the sunshine of a summer evening, so they lived their joyous lives. And even the full share of the sadder experiences of life which came to all of them but drove them the further into the secret place, and led them with more consecration to make, as they expressed it, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>portion.&quot; </span>All that has been said since from Marcus Aurelius to Swedenborg, from Augustine to Schleiermacher, of a besetting God as the full complement of humanity is but a repetition of the Hebrew poets&#39; faith. And even the New Testament has nothing higher to offer man than this.

Prayer is the sovereign remedy the godly fly to in all their extremities. The saints in sorrows have fled for comfort and healing unto prayers and supplications. Heaven is a shop full of all good things&#8212;there are stored up blessings and mercies; this the children of God know who fly to this shop in their troubles, begging for help from this holy sanctuary. &quot;In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord &quot; : Ps. Ixxvii. 2.

This is the tone and tune of men in distress. Man in misery earnestly sues for speedy delivery.

David, a man after God&#39;s own heart, is yet brought low with the faintness and failing of his heart, in waiting for help from God. &quot;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread &quot; (Gen. iii. 19); this lies upon the sons of men. But here, not sweat of face only, that were but small; but sighs and fainting of the heart lie upon the sous of God. in seeking and hungering after a taste of God&#39;s bread of life, inward comfort, assurance, and joy of the Holy Ghost. Thus the Church was brought to this sick bed ere her comfort came: &quot;For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me:&quot; Lam. i. 16. The disciples&#39; spirits were even failing in the tempest, when Christ slept and seemed to neglect them, as if he cared not though they perished. Howshould our spirits do other but fail, when our Comforter sleeps, when our only friend seems to be our enemy?</p>

It is a strong motive in our prayers to move him, for he is pitiful, and will not let his children utterly fail and perish ; he is a pitiful Spirit to failing spirits. &quot;I will not contend (saith the Lord) for ever, neither will I be always wroth ;&quot; why? we deserve his wrath should last and take fire for ever against us; yea, but (saith the Lord) this is the reason, &quot;The spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made&quot; (Isaiah Ivii. 16) : I love and pity the fainting souls and spirits of men: 1 will help my children; how can I see my creatures whom I made and do love, to perish for want of my help? David knew the Lord&#39;s nature, and that this was a speeding argument in prayer, which made him here and elsewhere so often use it.

When man&#39;s cruse of oil is dry, and fails, and can drop no more, then is God&#39;s time to prepare his.

In the sixth verse we find him thirsting after God ; and now that thirst is become so intense that it admits of no delay. In the beginning of the psalm he was content to say, &quot;Hear my prayer&quot;; but now he cries, &quot;Hear me <span style='font-style:italic;'>speedily.&#39;&#39; </span>This is not the language of sinful impatience: it is, indeed, good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of God; yet a man may desire, not only an answer, but also a speedy answer, without incurring the charge of impatience. Whatever a man desires to have he desires to have soon ; nor can he be otherwise than grieved at anything which delays the accomplishment of his wishes. In such desire or grief there is nothing sinful, provided it do not lead to murmuring or distrust of God. Hence this petition for <span style='font-style:italic;'>speedy </span>relief, and manifestation of God&#39;s presence and favour is very frequent with the Psalmist. He often prays, &quot;Make haste, O Lord, to deliver; make haste to help me, O Lord.&quot; Nay, if a man does not desire the light of God&#39;s countenance soon, it is a certain proof that he does not desire it at all. If the natural language of his heart be not, &quot;hear me speedily,&quot; delay is to him no exercise of patience. The very idea of patience implies that something is contrary to our wish ; and the stronger the desire is, the more difficult will that exercise of patience become.</p>

He is afraid lest if God should long delay, and withdraw himself, faith and hope could hold out no longer. He therefore pleads, &quot;hide not thy face from me, lest I become like them that go down into the pit&quot;; and urges the failing of his spirit before him who &quot; will not contend for ever, lest the spirit should fail before him.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Faweett. </span></p>

Even by <span style='font-style:italic;'>hearing </span>it, as he saith in the fifty-first psalm: &quot;Make me to hear joy and gladness.&quot; The voice which is heard is the word of God, which, being apprehended by faith, is able to comfort our souls in whatsoever temptation. It is no marvel that such atheists and papists who altogether refuse the word of God, live comfortless and die without comfort, because they refuse that instrument which should carry joy to them. Good reason they die athirst, since they reject that vessel, the word of God, by which they might be refreshed. Therefore since faith cometh by hearing of God&#39;s word, and all our comfort cometh by it, let us pray God to bore our ears and our hearts, that we may receive the glad tidings of reconciliation from God.</p>

We would have the Lord&#39;s promise run thus,&#8212;Your sorrows shall not endure the whole night, your joy shall come long before the morning. The luxurious Emperor [? Smyndirides the Svbarite] and his drunken mates sat and drank all the night, and slept all tho day. insomuch that it was said of them, they never saw sun-set nor sun-rise. Such would we have the evils we suffer&#8212;of <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Po </span>short continuance that neither sunset nor sun-rise might see us in our misery. This makes me wonder at that stranire Egyptian beast called Pharaoh, who being demanded of Moses when he would have God&#39;s plague of the frogs removed, answered, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;To-morrow.&quot; </span>Surely, here he spake not as a man, to whom one hour&#39;s trouble is accounted a day, a day a month, a month a year. For in leaving of two things we change our desires, and are much different.</p>

In leaving of sin, then we procrastinate and put off; and when God says, &quot;To-day hear my voice,&quot; we answer, &quot;To-morrow,&quot; and are like the Levite&#39;s wife&#39;s father (Judg. xix. 6), too kind hosts to such bad guests: saying to our sins, &quot;tarry till the&#39;morning.&quot; Our pace to repentance is slow, we are far from haste in that matter.</p>

But for afflictions to leave us, then we wish they had feet like hinds&#39; feet, to run away from us, or we the wings of a dove to fly away from them, and be at rest. . . . What prisoner desires not to be presently set free, and that liberty&#39;s soft hand may loose his iron knots <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>What mariner wishes a long storm? What servant sighs not over his hard apprenticeship? Yea, who is he, that if there were an appearance of an offering to take the cup of calamity from his mouth, saying, &quot;Thou shalt drink no more,&quot; would answer, &quot;This cup shall not yet pass from me, I delight to carouse and drink deeply of these bitter waters&quot; J Yea, this desire extends so far that it comes to the Son of man, the blessed Seed of the woman, who was so clad with human weakness that he earnestly prayed for speedy help from his heavy anguish; and that not once, but often, &#8212;&quot; Oh, my Father, if it be possible,&quot; etc. ; and when his Father answers not, he cries like one ready to fall under the burden, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; The reason for Christ&#39;s thus complaining is to be fetched from thence, whence his flesh came; even from us. It was our human flesh, not his Divine spirit, which was so weary of suffering; his spirit was willing, it was our flesh that was so weak. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cahert. </span></p>
