It is saddening to remember how this majestic word bas been trailed in the mire of late. Its irreverent use is an aggravated instance of taking the name of Jehovah our God in vain. Let us hope that it has been done in ignorance by the ruder sort; but great responsibility lies with leaders who countenance and even copy this blasphemy. With holy awe let us pronounce the word <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Hallelujah, </span>and by it summon ourselves and all others to adore the God of the whole earth. Men need to be called to praise; it is important that they should praise; and there are many reasons why they should do it at once.

soul, and if it be saved from eternal wrath, it is bound to praise its Saviour. Come heart, mind, thought! Come my whole being, my soul, my all, be all on flame with joyful adoration! Up, my brethren! Lift up the song !&quot; Praise ye the Lord.&quot; But what am I at? How dare 1 call upon others, and be negligent myself?

This mortal life will find a finis in death; but while it lasts I will laud the Lord my God. I cannot tell how long or short my life may be; but every hour of it shall be given to the praises of my God. While I live I&#39;ll love; and while I breathe I&#39;ll bless. It is but for a while, and I will not while that time away in idleness, but consecrate it to that same service which shall occupy eternity.

This &quot; while I have any being&quot; will be a great while, but the whole of it shall be filled up with adoration; for the glorious Jehovah is my God, my own God by covenant, and by blood relationship in Christ Jesus. I have no being apart from my God, therefore, I will not attempt to enjoy my being otherwise than by singing to his honour. Twice the Psalmist says &quot;I will &quot; ; here first thoughts and second thoughts are alike good. We cannot be too firm in the holy resolve to praise God, for it is the chief end of our living and being that we should glorify God and enjoy him for ever.</p>

In any case it comes from the Spirit of the living God. Men are always far too apt to depend upon the great ones of earth, and forget the Great One above; and this habit is the fruitful source of disappointment. Princes are only men, and men with greater needs than others; why, then, should we look to them for aid? They are in greater danger, are burdened with greater cares, and are more likely to be misled than other men ; therefore, it is folly to select them for our confidence. Probably no order of men have been so false to their promises and treaties as men of royal blood. So live as to deserve <span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span>trust, but do not burden them with your trust. &quot;JVor <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>son </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>help.&quot; </span>Though you should select one son of man out of the many, and should imagine that he differs from the rest and may be safely depended on, you will be mistaken. There is none to be trusted, no, not one. Adam fell; therefore lean not on his sons. Man is a helpless creature without God ; therefore, look not for help in that direction. All men are like the few men who are made into princes, they are more in appearance than in reality, more in promising than in performing, more apt to help themselves than to help others. How many have turned away heart-sick from men on whom they once relied! Never was this the case with a believer in the Lord. He is a very present help in time of trouble. In man there is no help in times of mental depression, in the day of sore bereavement, in the night of conviction of sin, or in the hour of death. What a horror when most in need of help to read those black words, NO HELP!</p>

Man who comes from the earth returns to the earth : it is the mother and sister of his body, and he must needs lie among his kindred as soon as the spirit whioh was his life has made its exit. There is a spirit in man, and when that goes the man goes. The spirit returns to God who gave it, and the flesh to the dust out of which it was fashioned. This is a poor<a id='GBS.PA381.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.400.1.0.box.194.239.1306.567.q.60'>

Those hopes will surely fall to the ground which are built upon men who <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Bo </span>soon lie under ground, &quot;/re <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>very </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>day </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thoughts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perish.&quot; </span>Whatever he may have proposed to do, the proposal ends in smoke. He cannot think, and what he had thought of cannot effect itself, and therefore it dies. Now that he is gone, men are ready enough to let his thoughts go with him into oblivion; another thinker comes, and turns the thoughts of his predecessor to ridicule. It is a pitiful thing to be waiting upon princes or upon any other men, in the hope that they will think of us. In an hour they are gone, and where are their schemes for our promotion? A day has ended their thoughts by ending <span style='font-style:italic;'>them</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>and our trusts have perished, for their thoughts have perished. Men&#39;s ambitions, expectations, declarations, and boastings all vanish into thin air when the breath of life vanishes from their bodies. This is the narrow estate of man: his breath, his earth, and his thoughts; and this is his threefold climax therein,&#8212;his breath goeth forth, to his earth he returns, and his thoughts perish. Is this a being to be relied upon? Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. To trust it would be a still greater vanity.</span></p>

He has happiness indeed : the true and the real delight is with him. The God of Jacob is the God of the covenant, the God of wrestling prayer, the God of the tried believer; he is the only living and true God. The God of Jacob is Jehovah, who appeared unto Moses, and led the tribes of Jacob out of Egypt, and through the wilderness. Those are happy who trust him, for they shall never be ashamed or confounded. The Lord never dies, neither do his thoughts perish : his purpose of mercy, like himself, endures throughout all generations. Hallelujah !&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hope </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&quot; </span>He is happy In help for the present and in hope for the future, who has placed all his confidence in Jehovah, who is his God by a covenant of salt. Happy is he when others are despairing! Happiest shall he be in that very hour when others are discovering the depths of agony. We have here a statement which we have personally tried and proved: resting in the Lord, we know a happiness which is beyond description, beyond comparison, beyond conception. O how blessed a thing it is to know that God is our present help, and our eternal hope. Full assurance is more than heaven in the bud, the flower has begun to open. We would not exchange with Caesar; his sceptre is a bauble, but our bliss is true treasure.</p>

Either one of them has a fountain of joy in it; but the first will not cheer us without the second. Unless Jehovah be his God no man can find confidence in the fact that he was Jacob&#39;s God. But when by faith we know the Lord to be ours, then we are &quot; rich to all the intents of bliss.&quot;</p>

He who made heaven can make a heaven for us, and make us fit for heaven. He who made the earth can preserve us while we are on earth, and help us to make good use of it while we sojourn upon it. He who made the sea and all its mysteries can steer us across the pathless deeps of a troubled life, and make it a way for his redeemed to pass over. This God who still makes the world by keeping it in existence is assuredly able to keep us to his eternal kingdom and glory. The making of the worlds is the standing proof of the power and wisdom of that great God in whom we trust. It is our joy that be not only made heaven, but the sea ; not only things which are bright and blessed, but things which are deep and dark. Concerning all our circumstances, we may say the Lord is there. In storms and hurricanes the Lord reigneth as truly as in that great calm which rules the firmament above. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iceepeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>This is a second and most forcible justification of our trust: the Lord will never permit his promise to fail.

Our King surpasses all earthly princes because he pays no deference to rank or wealth, and is never the respecter of persons. He is the friend of the down-trodden, the avenger of the persecuted, the champion of the helpless. Safely may we trust our cause with such a Judge if it be a just one: happy are we to be under such a Ruler. Are we &quot; evil entreated &quot;? Are our rights denied us? Are we slandered? Let this console us, that he who occupies the throne will not only think upon our case, but bestir himself to execute judgment on our behalf. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>givethfood </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hungry.&quot; </span>Glorious King art thou, O Jehovah! Thou dost not only mete out justice but thou dost dispense bounty! All food comes from God ; but when we are reduced to hunger, and providence supplies our necessity, we are peculiarly struck with the fact. Let every hungry man lay hold on this statement, and plead it before the mercy-seat, whether he suffer bodily-hunger, or heart-hunger. See how our God finds his special clients among the lowest of mankind : the oppressed and the starving find help in the God of Jacob. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;font-style:italic;'>Loud </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>looseth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>prisoners.&quot; </span>Thus he completes the triple blessing: justice, bread, and liberty. Jehovah loves not to see men pining in dungeons, or fretting in fetters: he brought up Joseph from the round-house, and Israel from the house of bondage. Jesus is the Emancipator, spiritually, providentially, and nationally. Thy chains, O Africa! were broken by his hand. As faith in Jehovah shall become common among men freedom will advance in every form, especially will mental, moral, and spiritual bonds be loosed, and the slaves of error, sin, and death shall be set free. Well might the Psalmist praise Jehovah, who is so kind to men in bonds! Well may the loosened ones be loudest in the song!</p>

He who made the eye can open it, and when he does so it is to his glory. How often is the mental eye closed in moral night! And who can remove this dreary effect of the fall but the Almighty God? This miracle of grace he has performed in myriads of cases, and it is in each case a theme for loftiest praise. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;The </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>raixeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bowed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down.&#39;&#39; </span>This also Jesus did literally, thus doing the work peculiar to God. Jehovah consoles the bereaved, cheers the defeated, solaces the despondent, comforts the despairing. Let those who are bowed to the ground appeal to him, and he will speedily upraise them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>loveth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteous.&quot; </span>He gives to them the love of complacency, communion, and reward. Bad kings affect the licentious, but Jehovah makes the upright to be his favoured ones. This is greatly to his glory. Let those who enjoy the inestimable privilege of his love magnify his name with enthusiastic delight. Loved ones, you must never be absent from the choir! You must never pause from his praise whose infinite love has made you what you are.</p>

In this country the stranger was, a little while ago, looked upon as a vagabond,&#8212; a kind of wild beast to be avoided if not to be assaulted; and even to this day there are prejudices against foreigners which are contrary to our holy religion.

The Mosaic law made provision for these destitute persons.

Some will be thankful while the memory of a deliverance is fresh, and then leave off. The Carthaginians used, at first, to send the tenth of their yearly revenue to Hercules; and then by degrees they grew weary, and left off sending; but we must be constant in our eucharistic sacrifice, or thank-offering. The motion of our praise must be like the motion of our pulse, which beats as long as life lasts. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomcu </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Watson. </span></p>

But if it is said to him, &quot;God freeth thee,&quot; he is chilled, so to speak, by despair. The aid of a mortal is promised, and thou rejoicest; the aid of the Immortal is promised, and art thou sad? It is promised thee that thou shalt be freed by one who needeth to be freed with thee, and thou exultest as at some great aid: thou art promised that great Liberator, who needeth none to free him, and thou despairest, as though it were but a fable.
