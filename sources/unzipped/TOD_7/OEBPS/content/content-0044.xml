He sees God with his mind&#39;s eye, and simply addresses him with the pronoun &quot; thee.&quot; He is resolved to praise the Lord, and to do it with the whole force of his life, even with his whole heart. He would not submit to act as one under restraint, because of the opinions of others; but in the presence of the opponents of the living God he would be as hearty in worship as if all were friends and would cheerfully unite with him. If others do not praise the Lord, there is all the more reason why we should do so, and should do so with enthusiastic eagerness. We need a broken heart to mourn our own sins, but a whole heart to praise the Lord&#39;s perfections. If ever our heart is whole and wholly occupied with one thing, it should bo when we are praising the Lord. <span style='font-style:italic;'>^&#39;Bf.fore </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>goih </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nimj </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thfe.&quot; </span>Why should these idols rob Jehovah of his praises? The Psalmist will not for a moment suspend his songs because there are images before him, and their foolish worshippers might not approve of his music. I believe David referred to the false gods of the neighbouring nations, and the deities of the surviving Canaanites. He was not pleased that such gods were set up; but he intended to express at once his contempt of <span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span>and his own absorption in the worship of the living Jehovah by continuing most earnestly to sing wherever he might be. It would be paying these dead idols too much respect to cease singing because they were perched aloft. In these days when new religions are daily excogitated, and new gods are set up, it is well to know<a id='GBS.PA205.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.224.1.0.box.250.248.1301.428.q.60'>
how to act. Bitterness is forbidden, and controversy is apt to advertise the heresy; the very best method is to go on personally worshipping the Lord with unvarying zeal, singing with heart and voice his royal praises. Do they deny the Divinity of our Lord? Let us the more fervently adore him. Do they despise the atonement? Let us the more constantly proclaim it. Had half the time spent in councils and controversies been given to praising the Lord, the church would have been far sounder and stronger than she is at this day. The Hallelujah Legion will win the day. Praising and singing are our armour against the idolatries of heresy, our comfort under the depression caused by insolent attacks upon the truth, and our weapons for defending the gospel. Faith, when displayed in cheerful courage, has about it a sacred contagion: others learn to believe in the Most High when they see his servant</span></p>

He would worship God in God&#39;s own way. The Lord had ordained a centre of unity, a place of sacrifice, a house of his indwelling; and David accepted the way of worship enjoined by revelation. Even so, the truehearted believer of these days must not fall into the will-worship of superstition, or the wild worship of scepticism, but reverently worship as the Lord himself prescribes. The idol gods had their temples; but David averts his glance from them, and looks earnestly to the spot chosen of the Lord for his own sanctuary. We are not only to adore the true God, but to do so in his own appointed way: the Jew looked to the temple, we are to look to Jesus, the living temple of the Godhead. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>loving </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>kindness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>Praise would be the main part of David&#39;s worship; the name or character of God the great object of his song; and the special point of his praise the grace and truth which shone so conspicuously in that name. The person of Jesus is the temple of the Godhead, and therein we behold the glory of the Father, &quot;full of grace and truth.&quot; It is upon these two points that the name of Jehovah is at this time assailed&#8212;his grace and his truth. He is said to be too stern, too terrible, and therefore &quot; modern thought&quot; displaces the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and sets up an effeminate deity of its own making. As for us, we firmly believe that God is love, and that in the summing up of all things it will be seen that hell itself is not inconsistent with the beneficence of Jehovah, but is, indeed, a necessnry part of his moral government now that sin has intruded into the universe. True believers hear the thunders of his justice, and yet they do not doubt his lovingkindness. Especially do we delight in God&#39;s great love to his own elect, such as he showed to Israel as a race, and more especially to David and his seed when he entered into covenant with him. Concerning this there is abundant room for praise. But not only do men attack the lovingkindness of God, but the truth of God is at this time assailed on all sides; some doubt the truth of the inspired record as to its histories, others challenge the doctrines, many sneer at the prophecies; in fact, the infallible word of the Lord is at this time treated as if it were the writing of impostors, and only worthy to be carped at. The swine are trampling on the pearls at this time, and nothing restrains them; nevertheless, the pearls are pearls still, and shall yet shine about our Monarch&#39;s brow. We sing the lovingkindness and truth of the God of the Old Testament,&#8212;&quot; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.&quot; David before the false gods first sang, then worshipped, and then proclaimed the grace and truth of Jehovah; let us do the same before the idols of the New Theology.</p>

nature to redeem humanity. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the divine word will not pass away, and in this respect especially it has a pre-eminence over every other form of manifestation. Moreover, the Lord lays all the rest of his name under tribute to his word : his wisdom, power, love, and all his other attributes combine to carry out his word. It is his word which creates, sustains, quickens, enlightens, and comforts. As a word of command it is supreme; and in the person of the incarnate Word it is set above all the works of God&#39;s hands. The sentence in the text is wonderfully full of meaning. We have collected a vast mass of literature upon it, but space will not allow us to put it all into our notes. Let us adore the Lord who has spoken to us by his word, and by his Son; and in the presence of unbelievers let us both praise his holy name and extol bis holy word.</span></p>

No man doubts the power of prayer after he has received an answer of peace to his supplication. It is the distinguishing mark of the true and living God that he hears the pleadings of bis people, and answers them; the gods hear not and answer not, but Jehovah&#39;s memorial is&#8212;&quot; the God that heareth prayer.&quot; There was some special day in which David cried more vehemently than usual; he was weak, wounded, worried, and his heart was wearied; then like a child he &quot; cried,&quot;&#8212;cried unto his Father. It was a bitter, earnest, eager prayer, as natural and as plaintive as the cry of a babe. The Lord answered it; but what answer can there be to a cry ?&#8212;to a mere inarticulate wail of grief? Our heavenly Father is able to interpret tears, and cries, and he replies to their inner sense in such a way as fully meets the case. The answer came in the same day as the cry ascended: so speedily does prayer rise to heaven, so quickly does mercy return to earth. The statement of this sentence is one which all believers can make, and as they can substantiate it with many facts, they ought boldly to publish it, for it is greatly to God&#39;s glory. Well might the Psalmist say, &quot;I will worship&quot; when he felt bound to say &quot; thou answeredst me.&quot; Well might he glory before the idols and their worshippers when he had answers to prayer to look back upon. This also is our defence against modern heresies: we cannot forsake the Lord, for he has heard our prayers.</p>

If the burden was not removed, yet strength was given wherewith to bear it, and this is an equally effective method of help. It may not be best for us that the trial should come to an end ; it may be far more to our advantage that by its pressure we should learn patience. Sweet are the uses of adversity, and our prudent Father in heaven will not deprive us of those benefits. Strength imparted to the soul is an inestimable boon ; it means courage, fortitude, assurance, heroism. By his word and Spirit the Lord can make the trembler brave, the sick whole, the weary bright. This soul-might will continue: the man having been strengthened for one emergency remains vigorous for life, and is prepared for all future labours and sufferings; unless, indeed, he throw away his force by unbelief, or pride, or some other sin. When God strengthens, none can weaken. Then is our soul strong indeed when the Lord infuses might into us.</p>

What praise ! when they all in happy union lift up their songs uato the Lord. Kings are as gods below, and they do well when they worship the God above. The way of conversion for kings is the same as for ourselves: faith to them also cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Happy are those who can cause the word of the Lord to penetrate palaces; for the occupants of thrones are usually the last to know the joyful sounds of the gospel. David, the king, cared for kings&#39; souls, and it will be wise for each man to look first after those who are of his own order. He went to his work of testimony with full assurance of success: he meant to speak only the words of Jehovah&#39;s mouth, and he felt sure that the kings would hear and praise Jehovah.</p>

How often has the Lord quickened us by our soi rows! Are they not his readiest means of exciting to fulness of energy the holy life which dwells within us?

Our foes fall when the Lord comes to deal with them; he makes short work of the enemies of his people,&#8212;with one hand he routs them. His wrath soon quenches their wrath ; his hand stays their hand. Adversaries may be many, and malicious, and mighty ; but our glorious Defender has only to stretch out his arm and their armies vanish. The sweet singer rehearses his assurance of salvation, and sings of it in the ears of the Lord, addressing him with this confident language. He will be saved,&#8212;saved dexterously, decidedly, divinely; he has no doubt about it. God&#39;s right haud cannot forget its cunning; Jerusalem is his chief joy, and he will defend his own elect.</span></p>

If there be anything good in us, it is the work of God&#39;s own hands: will he leave it? Why has he wrought so much in us if he means to give us up ?&#8212;it will be a sheer waste of effort. He who has gone so far will surely persevere with us to the end. Our hope for the final perseverance of the believer lies in the final perseverance of the believer&#39;s God. If the Lord begins to build, and does not finish, it will not be to his honour. He will have a desire to the work of his hands, for he knows what it has cost him already, and he will not throw away a vessel upon which he has expended so much of labour and skill. Therefore do we praise him with our whole heart, even in the presence of those who depart from his Holy Word, and set up another God and another gospel; which are not another, but there be some that trouble us.</p>

He humbleth himself to behold the things of the children of men; he condescends to men of low estate. Of the blessed Jesus it is said, that &quot; though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich&quot; : 2 Cor. viii. 9. Who can tell the depths to which God condescends in loving thought? We are told that the very hairs of our head are all numbered ; and if the hairs of our head, then surely all else beside. God, as the Heavenly Father, takes an interest in everything about his people; he takes this interest in matters which they think beneath his notice, or of which they, from their ignorance, do not know the importance. The mother may draw whole stores of comfort from a realization of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>condesccnding </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thoughtfvlness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span>He will be interested about her babe; if she commit it to him, he who made the universe will, with his infinite mind, think upon her cradle and the helpless creature that is rocked to sleep therein. The sick man may draw whole stores of comfort from the same source, for he can believe the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>One </span>by whom the body was fearfully and wonderfully made will think over the sufferings of that body, and alleviate them, or give strength for the endurance of them if they must be borne. Condescension of thought marks all the dealings of God with his people. And hard following upon it comes <span style='font-style:italic;'>tenderness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>action. </span>Now this &quot;tenderness in action&quot; is a great part of the lovingkindness of God ; it is meet that a thoughtful mind and tender hand should go together in the perfection of love. God is not only energetic, but tender also in action; he is the God of the dew-drops, as well as the God of the thunder showers; the God of the tender grass blade, as much as of the mountain oak. We read of great machines, which are able to crush iron bars, and yet they can touch so gently as not to break the shell of the smallest egg; as it is with<a id='GBS.PA211.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.230.1.0.box.284.270.1305.177.q.50'>
them, so is it with the hand of the Most High; he can crush a world, and yet bind up a wound.

In his providential dealings, also, is much of his wisdom and goodness exhibited. But of his perfections, generally, we can form no idea from these things; of his purposes we can know nothing. The state of the Heathen world clearly attests this; for they behold the wonders of Creation and Providence, as well as we: &quot;There is no speech nor language where <span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span>voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world &quot; : Ps. xix. 3, 4. But in the sacred volume all the glory of the Godhead shines: there we are admitted, so to speak, even to the council-chamber of the Most High ; to hear the covvnnnt entered into between the Father and the Son ; the Father engaging to give to him a seed, whom he should have for his inheritance, if he, on his part, would &quot;make his soul an offering for their sins,&quot; and, in their nature, expiate the guilt of their iniquities. This mysterious transaction having taken place in the incarnntion and death of the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold all the perfections of God united and harmonizing in a way that they never did, or could, by any other means: we see justice more inexorable, than if it had executed vengeance on the whole human race; and mercy more abundant, than if it had spared the whole human race without any such atonement. There, as it is well expressed, &quot; Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other<sup>&#8226;</sup>&#39;: Ps. !xxxv. 10. Of this great mystery we find not a trace in the whole creation besides; but in the word it is reflected, as in a mirror (2 Cor. iii. 18) ; and it shines so brightly, that the very angels around the throne are made wiser by the revelation of it to the Church : Eph. iii. 10.</p>

imparts are spiritual and eternal; from whence we derive all our knowledge of Divine truth, and all our hopes of everlasting salvation. Nor is it the knowledge only of truth that we obtain, but the operation and efficacy of it on our souls. There is in Divine truth, when applied by the Holy Spirit, a power to wound, to sanctify, to save : <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Pr. </span>xix. 7&#8212;11. When it comes to the soul with power, the stoutest heart in the universe is made to tremble: when it is poured out as balm, the most afflicted creature under heaven is made to leap for joy. Look over the face of the globe, and see how many, who were once under the unrestrained dominion of sin, are now transformed into the image of their God. And then ascend to heaven, and behold the myriads of the redeemed around the throne of God, uniting their hallelujahs to God and to the Lamb: to this state were they all brought by that blessed word, which alone could ever prevail for so great a work. Thus it is that God has magnified his word; and thus it is that he <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span>magnify it, to the end of time; yea, through eternity will it be acknowledged as the one source of all blessings that shall ever be enjoyed. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Charles </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Simeon, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mora </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Homileticai. </span></span></p>

And yet he has &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>magnified</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot; </span>something &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>above </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hu </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212;his <span style='font-style:italic;'>word</span>&#8212;his <span style='font-style:italic;'>truth. </span>This may refer to the Incarnate Word, the Son of God, who was called &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Word.&quot; </span>&quot;There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Word, </span>and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one&quot; : 1 John v. 7, &quot;In the beginning was the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Word, </span>and the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Word </span>was with God &quot; : John i. 1. You may take the words either as meaning that God has magnified his <span style='font-style:italic;'>Word, </span>his eternal Son&#8212;above all his great nams, that is, he has set Jesus on high above all the other perfections of his majesty; or take it as meaning his written word, which is written in the sacred Scriptures. So, in that case, not only the Incarnate <span style='font-style:italic;'>Word </span>in the person of Jesus; but also the written word in the Scriptures of truth. He has magnified it above all his name in the fulfilment of it: God&#39;s faithfulness being so dear to him, he has exalted his faithfulness above all his other perfections. We see this in nature. Here is a man so to bo depended upon, so faithful to his word, that he will sacrifice anything sooner than depart from it: that man will give up his property, or life itself, rather than forfeit his word. So God has spoken of magnifying his word above all his name. He would sooner allow all his other perfections to come to naught, than for his faithfulness to fail. He has so magnified his faithfulness, that his love, his mercy, his grace, would all sooner fuil than his faithfulness&#8212;the word of his mouth and what he has revealed in the Scripture. What a firm salvation, then, is ours, which rests upon his word, when God has magnified that word above all his name! What volumes of blessedness and truth are contained therein ! so that, if God has revealed his truth to your soul, and given you faith to anchor in the world of promise, sooner than that should fail, he would suffer the loss of all; for, he has magnified his word above all his name.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>PJiilliot. </span></p>

A pure influx into the mind of an apostle is no sufficient guarantee for the instruction of the world, unless there be a pure efflux also; for not the doctrine that has flowed in, but the doctrine that has flowed out, is truly all that we have to do with.

Though we may keep a well friend waiting should he send for us, yet we will give a sick friend leave to call us up at midnight. In such extremities we usually go with the messenger that comes for us; and so doth God with the prayer. Peter knocked at their gate, who were assembled to seek God for him, almost as soon as their prayer knocked at heaven gate in his behalf. And truly it is no more than needs, if we consider the temptations of our afflicted condition; we are prone then to be suspicious that our best friends forget us, and to think every stay a delay, and neglect of us; therefore God chooseth to show himself most kind at such a time. &quot;As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ&quot; : 2 Cor. i. 5. As man laid on trouble, so Christ laid in consolation: both tides rose and fell together; when it was spring-tide with him in affliction, it was so with him in his joy. We relieve the poor as their need incrcaseth ; so Christ comforts his people as their troubles multiply. And now, Christian, tell me, doth not thy dear Lord deserve a ready spirit in thee to meet any suffering with, for, or from him, who gives his sweetest comforts where his people are put to bear their saddest sorrows? Well may the servant do his work cheerfully when his master is so careful of him as with his own hands to bring him his breakfast into the fields. The Christian stays not till he comes to heaven for all his comfort. There indeed shall be the full supper, but there is a breakfast, Christian, of previous joys, more or less, which Christ brings to thee into the field, to be eaten on the place where thou endurest thy hardship.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nail. </span></span></p>
