With all his strength David blesses the God of his strength. We ought not to receive so great a boon as strength to resist evil, to defend truth, and to conquer error, without knowing who gave it to us, and rendering to him the glory of it. Not only does Jehovah give strength to his saints, but he is their strength. The strength is made theirs because God is theirs. God is full of power, and he becomes the power of those who trust him.

full of such suggestive symbols. The Psalmist in the second part of the verse Bets forth the Lord as teacher in the arts of war. If we have strength we are not much the better unless we have skill also. Untrained force is often an injury to the man who possesses it, and it even becomes a danger to those who are round about him; and therefore the Psalmist blesses the Lord as much for teaching as for strength. Let us also bless Jehovah if he has in anything made us efficient. The tuition mentioned was very practical, it was not so much of the brain as of the hands and fingers; for these were the members most needful for conflict. Men with little scholastic education should be grateful for deftness and skill in their handicrafts. To a fighting man the education of the hands,is of far more value than mere book-learning could ever be; he who has to use a sling or a bow needs suitable training, quite as much as a scientific man or a classical professor. Men are too apt to fancy that an artisan&#39;s efficiency is to be ascribed to himself; but this is a popular fallacy. A clergyman may be supposed to be taught of God, but people do not allow this to be true of weavers or workers in brass; yet these callings are specially mentioned in the Bible as having been taught to holy women and earnest men when the tabernacle was set up at the first. All wisdom and skill are from the Lord, and for them he deserves to be gratefully extolled. This teaching extends to the smallest members of our frame; the Lord teaches fingers as well as hands; indeed, it sometimes happens that if the finger is not well trained the whole hand is incapable.</span></p>

If the Lord deigns to have a hand in such unspiritual work as fighting, surely he will help us to proclaim the gospel and win souls; and then we will bless his name with even greater intensity of heart. We will be pupils, and he shall be our Master, and if we ever accomplish anything we will give our Instructor hearty blessing.</p>

It has also a presentness about it; for Jehovah is now his strength, and is still teaching him; we ought to make a point of presenting praise while yet the blessing is on the wing. The verse is also pre-eminently practical, and full of the actual life of every day; for David&#39;s days were spent in camps and conflicts. Some of us who are grievously tormented with rheumatism might cry, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my Comforter, who tcacheth my knees to bear in patience, and my feet to endure in resignation&quot; ; others who are on the look out to help young converts might say, &quot;Blessed be God who teaches my eyes to see wounded souls, and my lips to cheer them&quot; ; but David has his own peculiar help from God, and praises him accordingly. This tends to make the harmony of heaven perfect when all the singers take their parts; if we all followed the same score, the music would not be so full and rich.</p>

It is all of mercy that he is any of the other good things to us, so that this is a highly comprehensive title. O how truly has the Lord been mercy to many of us in a thousand ways! He is goodness itself, and he has been unbounded goodness to us. We have no goodness of our own, but the Lord has become goodness to us. So is ho himself also our <span style='font-style:italic;'>fortress </span>and safe abode: in him we dwell as behind impregnable ramparts and immovable bastions. We cannot be driven out, or starved out; for our fortress is prepared for a siege; it is stored with abundance of food, and a well of living water is within it.

forth the varied benefits which come to us from our Lord. He is every good thing which we can need for this world or the next.

The victories of peace are as much worthy of joyful gratitude as the victories of war. Leaders in the Christian church cannot maintain their position except as the Lord preserves to tliem the mighty influence which ensures obedience and evokes enthusiastic loyalty. For every particle of influence for good which we may possess let us magnify the name of the Lord.</span></p>

He is too little to be described at all ; only God, who knows the most minute object, can tell what man is. Certainly he is not fit to be the rock of our confidence: he is at once too feeble and too fickle to be relied upon. The Psalmist&#39;s wonder is that God should stoop to know him, and indeed it is more remarkable than if the greatest archangel should make a study of emmets, or become the friend of mites. God knows his people with a tender intimacy, a constant, careful observation: he foreknew them in love, he knows them by care, he will know them in acceptance at last. Why and wherefore is this? What has man done? What has he been I What is he now that God should know him, and make himself known to him as his goodness, fortress, and high tower? This is an unanswerable question. Infinite condescension can alone account for the Lord stooping to be the friend of man. That he should make man the subject of election, the object of redemption, the child of eternal love, the darling of infallible providence, the next of ki n to Deity, is indeed a matter requiring more than the two notes of exclamation found in this verse.</p>

and in connection with redeeming love makes a great figure of him: this can be believed, but ft cannot be explained. Adoring wonder makes us each one cry out, Why dost thou take knowledge of me? We know by experience how little man is to be reckoned upon, and we know by observation how greatly he can vaunt himself, if is therefore meet for us to be humble and to distrust ourselves; but all this should make us the more grateful to the Lord, who knows man better than we do, and yet communes with him, and even dwells in him.

Observe that human life is not only as a shade, but as a shade which is about to depart. It is a mere mirage, the image of a thing which is not, a phantasm which melts back into nothing.

David intended to tune his best instruments us well as to use his best vocal music: the best is all too poor for so greut <span style='font-style:italic;'>a. </span>God, an.I therefore we must not fall short of our utmost. He meant to use many instruments of music, that by all means he might express his great joy in God. The Old Testament dispensation abounded in types, and figures, and outward ritual, and therefore music dropped naturally into its place in the &quot;worldly sanctuary&quot;; but, after all, it can do no more than represent praise, and assist our expression of it; the real praise is in the heart, the true music is that of the soul. When music drowns the voice, and artistic skill takes a higher place than hearty singing, it is time that instruments were banished from public worship; but when they are subordinate to the song, as here, it is not for us to prohibit them, or condemn those who use them, though we ourselves greatly prefer to do without them, since it seems to us that the utmost simplicity of praise is far more congruous with the spirit of the gospel than pomp of organs. The private worshipper, singing his solo unto the Lord, has often found it helpful to accompany himself on some familiar instrument, and of this David in the present psalm is an instance, for he says, &quot;I will sing praise unto thee,&quot;&#8212;that is, not so much in the company of others as by himself alone. He saith not &quot;we,&quot; but &quot; I.&quot;</span></p>

In his many battles David would have perished had not almighty care preserved him. He had by his valour wrought salvation for Israel, but he lays his laurels at the feet of his Lord and Preserver.

Those who are surrounded by such serpents know not how to deal with them, and the only available method seems to be prayer to God for a riddance and deliverance. David in the seventh verse, according to the original, had sought the help of both the Lord&#39;s hands, and well he might, for his deceitful enemies, with remarkable unanimity, were with one mouth and one hand seeking his destruction.</p>

It is well when there is plenty, and that plenty consists of &quot; all manner of store.&quot; We have occasionally heard murmurs concerning the abundance of grain, and the cheapness of the poor man&#39;s loaf. A novel calamity! We dare not pray against it. David would have prayed for it, and blessed the Lord when, ho saw his heart&#39;s desire.

The present psalm bears a strong resemblance to David&#39;s last song in 2 Sam. xxii. and to Ps. xviii. Here we have a vision of Christ rejoicing ;&#8212;after his passion&#8212;risen in glory, and having ascended in triumph, and pleading for us at the right hand of God.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Christopher </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wordsworth. </span></p>

Ten verses complete the first part of the psalm, which falls into two divisions. The first portion contains, in verses 1 and 2, ten attributes of God,&#8212;three and seven, the seven divided into four and three. In like manner it contains ten requests to God in verses 5&#8212;7, divided precisely as the attributes. To this significance of the number ten for the first part, allusion is pointedly made in verse 9. Seven blessings are prayed for in the second part, four in verses 12, 13 (valiant sons, beautiful daughters, full store-houses, numerous flocks), and three in verse 14 (labouring oxen, no breach and diminution, no cry). The whole contains, apart from the closing epiphonem, which, as usual, stands outside the formal arrangement, seven strophes, each of two verges.</p>

But one would require to consider more exactly, what sort of reading is here to be thought of. It is only the psalms of David which form the ground-work of this new psalm. But that it is one of David&#39;s peculiarities to derive from his earlier productions a foundation for new ones, is evident from a variety of facts, which, if any doubt must still be entertained on the subject, would obtain a firm ground to stand upon in this psalm, which <span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span>only have<a id='GBS.PA336.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.355.1.0.box.229.239.1301.356.q.60'>
been composed by David. The way and manner of the use made of such materials is to be kept in view. This is always of a spirited and feeling nature, and uo trace anywhere exists of a dead borrowing. That we cannot think here of such u borrowing; that the appropriation of the earlier language did not proceed from spiritual impotence, but rested upon deeper grounds, is manifest from the consideration of the second part, where the dependence entirely ceases, and where even the opponents of the Davidic authorship have not been able to overlook the strong poetical spirit of the time of David. They betake themselves to the miserable shift of affirming, that the Psalmist borrowed this part of the psalm from a much older poem now lost.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>E. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hengstvriberg. </span></span></p>

Thus he taught Samson by abstaining from strong drink, and by suffering no razor to pass over his head. Thus he taught the three kings in the wilderness to war against their enemies, not by any strength of their armies, but by making ditches in the desert. Thus he taught David himself by waiting for the sound of the going in the tops of the mulberry trees. And so he taught the arms of the True David to fight when stretched on the cross: nailed, to human sight, to the tree of suffering, but, in reality, winning for themselves the crown of glory : helpless in the eyes of Scribes and Pharisees; in those of archangels, laying hold of the two pillars, sin and death, whereon the house of Satan rested, and heaving them up from their foundation.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Ayguun, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ncnle </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lAMedale. </span></p>

He was <span style='font-style:italic;'>bold </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>attack, </span>for he began the combat by going up into the wilderness to defy the enemy.
