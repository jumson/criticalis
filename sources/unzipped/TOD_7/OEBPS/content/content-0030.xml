David would not think himself housed till he had built a house for the Lord, nor would he reckon himself rested till he had said, &quot;Arise, O Lord, into thy rest.&quot; Alas, we have many around us who will never carry their care for the Lord&#39;s worship too far! No fear of their being indiscreet! They are housed and bedded, and as for the Lord, his people may meet in a barn, or never meet at all, it will be all the same to them. Observe that Jacob in his vow spoke of the stone being God&#39;s house, and David&#39;s vow also deals with a house for God.</p>

It is a strong expression, and it is not to be coolly discussed by us. Remember that the man was all on fire, and he was writing poetry also, and therefore his language is not that which we should employ in cold blood. Everybody can see what he means, and how intensely he means it. Oh, that many more were seized with sleeplessness because the house of the Lord lies waste! They can slumber fast enough, and not even disturb themselves with a dream, though the cause of God should be brought to the lowest ebb by their covetousness. What is to become of those who have no care about divine things, and never give a thought to the claims of their God?</p>

At that time, in all David&#39;s land, there was no proper place for that ark whereon the Lord had placed the mercy-seat, where prayer could be offered, and where the manifested glory shone forth. All things had fallen into decay, and the outward forms of public worship were too much disregarded ; hence the King resolves to be first and foremost in establishing a bctter order of things.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA97.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.116.1.3.box.263.1323.1306.886.q.60'>Yet one cannot help remembering that the holy resolve of David gave to a place and a house much more importance than the Lord himself ever attached to such matters. This is indicated in Nathan&#39;s message from the Lord to the king&#8212;&quot; Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar I&quot; Stephen in his inspired speech puts the matter plainly: &quot;Solomon built him an house. Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands.&quot; It is a striking fact that true religion never flourished more in Israel than before the temple was built, and that from the day of the erection of that magnificent house the spirit of godliness declined. Good men may have on their hearts matters which seem to them of chief importance, and it may be acceptable with God that they should seek to carry them out; and yet in his infinite wisdom he may judge it best to prevent their executing their designs. God does not measure his people&#39;s actions by their wisdom, or want of wisdom, but by the sincere desire for his glory which has led up to them. David&#39;s resolution, though he was not allowed to fulfil it, brought a blessing upon him: the Lord promised to build the house of David, because he had desired to build the house of the Lord. Moreover, the King was allowed to prepare the treasure for the erection of the glorious edifice which was built by his son and successor. The Lord shows the acceptance of what we desire to do by permitting us to do something else which his infinite mind judges to be fitter for us, and more honourable to himself.</p>

Rumours came that it was somewhere in the land of Ephraim, in a temporary lodging; rather an object of dread than of delight. Is it not wonderful that so renowned a symbol of the presence of the Lord should be lingering in neglect&#8212;a neglect so great that it was remarkable that we should have heard of its whereabouts at all? When a man begins to think upon God and his service it is comforting that the gospel is heard of. Considering the opposition whirh it has encountered it is marvellous that it should be heard of, and heard of in a place remote from the central city; but yet we are sorrowful that it is only in connection with some poor despised place that we do hear of it. What is Ephratah? Who at this time knows where it was? How could the ark have remained there so long?</span></p>

It had to be hunted for high and low; and at last at Kirjath-jearim, the forest-city, he came upon it. How often dosouls find Christ and his salvation in out-of-the-way places! What matters where we meet with him so long as we do&#39;behold him, and find life in him? That is a blessed Eureka which is embedded in our text&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>found </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it.&quot; </span>The matter began with hearing, led on to a search, and concluded in a joyful find. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;We</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>found </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thefields </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wood.&quot; </span>Alas that there should be no room for the Lord in the palaces of kings, so that he must needs take to the woods. If Christ be in a wood he will yet be found of those who seek for him. He is as near in the rustic home, embowered among the trees, as in the open streets of the city; yea, he will answer prayer offered from the heart of the black forest where the lone traveller seems out of all hope of henring. The text presents us with an instance of one whose heart was set upon finding the place where God would meet with him ; this made him quick of hearing, and so the cheering news soon reached him. The tidings renewed his ardour, and led him to stick at no difficulties in his search; and so it came to pass that, where he could hardly have expected it, he lighted upon the treasure which he so much prized.</p>

He has many dwellings in one in the various courts of his house, and each of these shall receive the reverence due: in each the priest shall offer for us the appointed service; and our hearts shall go where our bodiesmay not enter. David is not alone, he is represented as having sought for the ark with others, for so the word &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>we&quot; </span>implies; and now they arc glad to attend him in his pilgrimage to the chosen shrine, saying, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>We </span>found it, <span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span>will go.&quot; Because these are the Lord&#39;s courts we will resort to them. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>We </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>worship </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his&#39; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>footstool.&quot; </span>The best ordered earthly house can be no more than the footstool of so great a King. His ark can only reveal the glories of his feet, according to his promise that he will make the place of his feet glorious: yet thither will we hasten with joy, in glad companionship, and there will we adorn him. Where Jehovah is, there shall he be worshipped. It is well not only to go to the Lord&#39;s house, but to <span style='font-style:italic;'>worship </span>there : we do but profane his tabernacles if we enter them for any other purpose.</p>

In these three verses we see the finders of the ark removing it to its appointed place, using a formula somewhat like to that used by Moses when he said, &quot;Rise up.

Vain would it be for the ark to bo settled if the Lord did not continue with it, and perpetually shine forth from between the cherubim. Unless the Lord shall rest with us there is no rest for us; unless the ark of his strength abide with us we are ourselves without strength. The ark of the covenant is here mentioned by a name which it well deserved; for in its captivity it smote its captors, and broke their gods, and when it was brought back it guarded its own honour by the death of those who dared to treat it with disrespect. The power of God was thus connected with the sacred chest. Reverently, therefore, did Solomon pray concerning it as he besought the living God to consecrate the temple by his presence. It is the Lord and the covenant, or rather say the covenant Jehovah whose presence we desire in our assemblies, and this presence is the strength of his people. Oh that the Lord would indeed abide in all the churches, and cause his power to be revealed in Zion.</span></p>

In this glorious robe our great High-priest is evermore arrayed, and he would have all his people adorned in the same manner. Then only are priests fit to appear before the Lord, and to minister for the profit of the people, when their lives are dignified with goodness. They must ever remember that they are God&#39;s priests, and should therefore wear the livery of their Lord, which is holiness: they are not only to have righteousness, but to be clothed with it, so that upon every part of them righteousness shall be conspicuous. Whoever looks upon God&#39;s servants should see holiness if they see nothing else. Now, this righteousness of the ministers of the temple is prayed for in connection with the presence of the Lord; and this instructs us that holiness is only to be found among those who commune with God, and only comes to them through his visitation of their spirits. God will dwell among a holy people; and on the other hand, where God is the people become holy.</p>

Holy persons have a right to great and demonstrative joy: they may shout because of it. Since they are saints, and thy saints, and thou hast come to dwell with them, O Lord, thou hast made it their duty to rejoice, and to let others know of their joy. The sentence, while it may read as a permit, is also a precept: saints are commanded to rejoice in the Lord. Happy religion which makes it a duty to be glad! Where righteousness is the clothing, joy may well be the occupation.</p>

How condescending was the Son of the Highest to take upon himself the form of a <span style='font-style:italic;'>servant, </span>to be anointed for us, and to go in before the mercy-seat to plead on our behalf!

Here we come to a grand covenant pleading of the kind which is always prevalent with the Lord. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sworn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>David.&#39;&#39; </span>We cannot urge anything with God which is equal to his own word and oath. Jehovah, swears that our faith may have strong confidence in it: he cannot forswear himself. He swears <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth, </span>for he means every word that he utters; men may be perjured, but none will be so profane as to imagine this of the God of truth. By Nathan this covenant of Jehovah was conveyed to David, and there was no delusion in it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>turn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it.&quot; </span>Jehovah is not a changeable being. He never turns from his purpose, much less from his promise solemnly ratified by oath. He turneth never. He is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent. What a rock they stand upon who have an immutable oath of God for their foundation! We know that this covenant was really made with Christ, the spiritual seed of David, for Peter quotes it at Pentecost, saying, &quot;Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ.&quot; Christ therefore sits on a sure throne for ever and ever, seeing that he has kept the covenant, and through him the blessing comes upon Zion, whose poor are blessed in him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fruit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>body </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>set </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>throne.&quot; </span>Jesus sprang from the race of David, as the evangelists are careful to record ; he was &quot;of the house and lineage of David &quot; : &#171;t this day he is the King of the Jews, and the Lord has also given him the heathen for his inheritance. He must reign, and of his kingdom there shall be no end. God himself has set him on the throne, and no rebellion of men or devils can shake his dominion. The honour of Jehovah is concerned in his reign, and therefore it is never in danger; for the Lord will not suffer his oath to be dishonoured.</p>

Considered as it related to temporal things it was no small blessing for David&#39;s dynasty to be secured the throne upon good behaviour. These monarcbs held their crowns from God upon the terms of loyalty to their superior Sovereign, the Lord who had elevated them to their high position. They were to be faithful to the covenant by obedience to the divine law, and by belief of divine truth. They were to accept Jehovah as their Lord and their Teacher, regarding him in both relations as in covenant with them. What a condesension on God&#39;s part to be their teacher! How gladly ought they to render intelligent obedience! What a proper, righteous, and needful stipulation for God to make that they should be true to him when the reward was the promise, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>children </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#187;it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>throne </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evermore.&quot; </span>If they will sit at his feet God will make them sit on a throne; if they will keep the covenant they shall keep the crown from generation to generation.</p>

No internal revolt or external attack could have overthrown the royal house of David: it fell by its own sin, and by nothing else. The Lord was continually provoked, but he was amazingly long-suffering, for long after seceding Israel had gone into captivity, Judah still remained. Miracles of mercy were shown to her. Divine patience exceeded all limits, for the Lord&#39;s regard for David was exceeding great. The princes of David&#39;s house seemed set on ruining themselves, and nothing could save them; justice waited long, but it was bound at last to unsheathe the sword and strike. Still, if in the letter man&#39;s breach of promise caused the covenant to fail, yet in spirit and essence the Lord has been true to it, for Jesus reigns, and holds the throne for ever. David&#39;s seed is still royal, for he was the progenitor according to the flesh of him who is King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>

Parents must see to it that their children know the fear of the Lord, and they must beg the Lord himself to teach them his truth. We have no hereditary right to the divine favour: the Lord keeps up his friendship to families from generation to generation, for he is loth to leave the descendants of his servants, and never does so except under grievous and long-continued provocation. As believers, we are all in a measure under some such covenant as that of David: certain of us can look backward for four generations of saintly ancestors, and we are now glad to look forward and to see our children, and our children&#39;s children, walking in the truth. Yet we know that grace does not run in the blood, and we are filled with holy fear lest in any of our seed there should be an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</p>

So was the church a mere Jebusite stronghold till grace chose it, conquered it, rebuilt it, and dwelt in it. Jehovah has chosen his people, and hence they are his people. He has chosen the church, and hence it is what it is. Thus in the covenant David and Zion, Christ and his people, go together. David is for Zion, and Ziou for David : the interests of Christ and his people are mutual. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>desired </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>habitation.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>David&#39;s question is answered. The Lord has spoken: the site of the temple is fixed : the place of the divine manifestation is determined. Indwelling follows upon election, and arises out of it: Zion is chosen, chosen for a habitation of God. The desire of God to dwell among the people whom he has chosen for himself is very gracious and yet very natural: his love will not rest apart from those upon whom he has placed it. God desires to abide with those whom he has loved with an everlasting love; and we do not wonder that it should be so, for we also desire the company of our beloved ones. It is a double marvel, that the Lord should choose and desire such poor creatures as we are : the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in believers is a wonder of grace parallel to the incarnation of the Son of God. God in the church is the wonder of heaven, the miracle of eternity, the glory of infinite love.</p>

here speaks. Think of rest for God! A Sabbath for the Eternal and a place of abiding for the Infinite. He calls Zion <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rest. </span>Here his love remains and displays itself with delight. &quot;He shall rest in his love.&quot; And this/or <span style='font-style:italic;'>ever. </span>He will not seek another place of repose, nor grow weary of his saints. In Christ the heart of Deity is filled with content, and for his sake he is satisfied with his people, and will be so world without end. These august words declare a distinctive choice&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span>and no other; a certain choice&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span>which is veil known to me; a present choice&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span>which is here at this moment. God has made his election of old, he has not changed it, and he never will repent of it : his church was his rest and <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span>his rest still. As he will not turn from his oath, so he will never turn from his choice. Oh, that we may enter into <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>rest, may be part and parcel of his church, and yield by our loving faith u delight to the mind of him who taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his merry. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;Here </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dwell; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>desired </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it.&quot; </span>Again are we rilled with wonder that he who fills all things should dwell in Zion&#8212;should dwell in his church. God does not unwillingly visit his chosen; he desires to dwell with them; he desires them. He is already in Zion, for he says <span style='font-style:italic;'>here, </span>as one upon the spot. Not only will he occasionally come to his church, but he will dwell in it, as his fixed abode. He cared not for the magnificence of Solomon&#39;s temple, but he determined that at the mercy-seat he would be found by suppliants, and that thence he would shine forth in brightness of grace among the favoured nation. All this, however, was but a type of the spiritual house, of which Jesus is foundation and cornerstone, upon which all the living stones are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. Oh, the sweetness of the thought that God <span style='font-style:italic;'>desires </span>to dwell in his people and rest among them! Surely if it be his desire he will cause it to be so. If the desire of the righteous shall be granted much more shall the desire of the righteous God be accomplished. This is the joy of our souls, for surely we shall rest in God, and certainly our desire is to dwell in him. This also is the end of our fears for the church of God ; for if the Lord dwell in her, she shall not be moved ; if the Lord desire her, the devil cannot destroy her.</span></p>

The breadth of earth is &quot; the bread that perisheth,&quot; but the bread of God endureth to life eternal. In the church where God rests his people shall not starve; the Lord would never rest if they did.

Righteousness is but one feature of blessing, salvation is the whole of it. What cloth of gold is this! What more than regal array! Garments of salvation ! we know who has woven them, who has dyed them, and who has given them to his people. These are the best robes for priests and preachers, for princes and people; there is none like them ; give them me. Not every priest shall be thus clothed, but only <span style='font-style:italic;'>her </span>priests, those who truly belong to Zion, by faith which is in Christ Jesus, who hath made them priests unto God. These are clothed by the Lord himself, and none can clothe as he does. If even the grass of the field is so clothed by the Creator as to outvie Solomon in all his glory, how must his own children be clad?

These joyful ones are not, however, the mimic saints of superstition, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>her </span>saints, saints of the Most High, &quot;sanctified in Christ Jesus.&quot; These shall be so abundantly blessed and so satisfied, and so apparelled that they can do no otherwise than shout to show their astonishment, their triumph, their gratitude, their exultation, their enthusiasm, their joy in the Lord. Zion has no dumb saints. The sight of God at rest among his chosen is enough to make the most silent shout. If the morning stars sang together when the earth and heavens were made, mnch more will all the sons of God shout for joy when the new heavens and the new earth are finished, and the Hew Jerusalem comes down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride for her husband. Meanwhile, even now the dwelling of the Lord among us is a perennial fountain of sparkling delight to all holy minds. This shouting for joy is guaranteed to Zion&#39;s holy ones : God says they <span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span>shout aloud, and depend upon it they will: who shall stop them of this glorying? The Lord hath said by his Spirit, &quot; let them shout,&quot; and then he has promised that &quot; they shall shout aloud &quot; : who is he that shall make them hold their peace? The Bridegroom is with them, and shall the children of the bride-chamber fast? Nay, verily, we rejoice, yea and will rejoice.</p>

David, indeed, in the first verse, asks of God to remember his afflictions, and then records his vow; and you may, perhaps, think that the vow was the consequence of his afflictions, and that he made it contingent on his deliverance. ... It is far more consistent with the character of David to look upon the affliction to which he alludes as resulting from the Lord&#39;s not permitting him to carry out his purpose of erecting an earthly habitation for the God of heaven, inasmuch as he had shed blood abundantly. And if, as is more than probable, amid that blood which he had shed, David&#39;s conscience recalled the blood of Uriah as swelling the measure, he could not but be deeply afflicted, even while he acknowledged the righteousness of the sentence.</p>

It is a necessary rule, that &quot;we be as sparing in making our vows as may be&quot; ; there being&#39; many great inconveniences attending frequent and multiplied vows. It is very observable, that the Scripture mentioneth very few examples of vows, compared with the many instances of very great and wonderful providences; as if it would give us some instances, that we might know what we have to do, and yet would give us but few, that we might know we are not to do it often. You read Jacob lived seven score and seven years (Gen. xlvii. 28); but you read, I think, but of one vow that he made. Our extraordinary exigencies are not many; and, I say, our vows should not be more. Let this, then, be the first necessary ingredient of a well-ordered vow. Let it be no oftener made than the pressing greatness of an evil to be removed, or the alluring excellency of a blessing extraordinary to be obtained, will well warrant. Jephthah&#39;s vow was so far right; he had just occasion; there was a great and pressing danger to be removed; there was an excellent blessing to be obtained: the danger was, lest Israel should be enslaved; the blessing was victory over their enemies. This warranted his vow, though his rashness marred it. It was in David&#39;s troubles that David sware, and vowed a vow to the Most High ; and Jacob forbare to vow until his more than ordinary case bade his vow, and warranted him in so doing: Gen. xxviii. 20.

Reason and the flesh do attribute more to riches, and such other worldly helps as man seeth and knoweth. All such carnal helps are very idols, which deceive men. and draw them to perdition; but this is the strength and fortitude of the people, to have God present with them. ...

And then others again say, that he meant it only of that stately cedar house, which he had lately built for himself at Jerusalem (2 Sam. vii. 1, 2), to wit, that he would not go into that house ; and so also that he would not go up unto his bed, nor (verse 4) give any sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, to wit, in that house. But neither of these expositions gives me any satisfaction. I rather take these to be hyperbolical expressions of the continual, exceeding great care wherewith he was perplexed about providing a settled place for the ark to rest in, like that in Prov. vi. 4, 5: &quot;Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids; deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter,&quot; etc. Neither is it any more in effect than if he had said, I will never lay by this care to mind myself in anything whatsoever: I shall never with any content abide in mine own house, nor with any quiet rest in my bed, until, etc.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Arthur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jack</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>son, </span>1593&#8212;1666.</p>

This idea was very prevalent in the period of the revival of the arts on the Continent, where the state bed, often six feet high, always stood on a dais in an alcove, richly curtained off from the saloon. In the East the same custom still continues, and a verse in the Koran declares it to be one of the delights of the faithful in paradise that &quot;they shall repose themselves on lofty beds&quot; (Cap. 56, &quot;The Inevitable&quot;). Frequently these state beds were composed of the most costly and magnificent materials. The prophet Amos speaks of ivory beds (Amos vi. 4) ; Nero had a golden one; that of the Mogul Aurungzeebe was jewelled; and, lastly, in the privy purse expenses of our own profligate Charles II., we read of a &quot; silver bedstead for Mrs. Gwynn.&quot; And to this day the state bedsteads in the viceregal palace at Cairo are executed in the same metal, and are supposed to have cost upwards of &#163;3,000 each.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>From </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Biblical </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Museum,&quot; </span>1879.</p>

This was in the tribe of Ephraim, and is probably the place meant by the Psalmist. Now the ark had been for a long series of years at Shiloh, which is in Ephraim, when it was taken to be present at the battle with the Philistines, in which Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were slain, and when thirty thousand of the Israelites lost their lives, together with the capture of the ark.

It gives no countenance to the idea of intercession on the part of deceased saints; for it is not a prayer to David, but a pleading with God for the sake of David. Nor does it support the idea of works of supererogation on the part of David; it only implies a special divine delight in David, on account of which God was pleased to honour David&#39;s name during succeeding generations; and if the delight itself is pure grace, the expression of it, in any way, must be grace. Nor does it even give countenance to the idea that God&#39;s converting and saving grace may be expected by any man because his parents or ancestors were delighted in by God ; for a plea of this character is in Scripture strictly confined to two instances, Abraham and David, with both of whom a special covenant was made, including their descendants, and it was just thiscovenant that authorised the use of the plea by those who by promise were specially interested, and by none others, and for the ends contemplated by the covenant. But it did prefigure the great Christian plea, &quot;For Christ Jesus&#39; sake&quot; ; just as God&#39;s selection of individual men and making them centres of revelation and religion, in the old time, prefigured &quot;The man Christ Jesus&quot; as the centre and basis of religion for all time. Hence in the plea, &quot;For Christ&#39;s sake,&quot; the old pleas referred to are abolished, as the Jewish ritual is abolished. Christ bids us use His name : John xiv. 13, 14 ; xvi. 26, etc. To believe the false notions mentioned above, or to trust in any other name for divine, gracious favour, is to dishonour the name of Christ. &quot;For Christ&#39;s sake&quot; is effective on account of the great covenant, the merits of Christ, and his session in heaven.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Field </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sevenoaks), </span>1883.</p>

The king declares himself to be a most eminent pattern of zeal, and God himself to be a most magnificent rewarder of his servants. The king debarreth himself of all worldly content, while he is busily providing to entertain God; and God, who filleth heaven and earth, vouchsafeth to lodge in that place which was provided by the king. The king presents his supplication not only for himself, but also for his charge, the priests, the people; and God restraineth not his blessing to the king, but also at his suit enlargeth it to church and commonweal. Finally, the king bindeth himself to make good his duty with a votive oath, and God restipulateth with an oath that which he promised both to king and kingdom : to the kingdom in the words that follow; but to the king in those that I have now read to you.</p>

God requites a building with a building. There is a very apt illusion in the word, upon which the son of Syrach also plays, when he saith, that children and the building of a city make a perpetual name; how much more if they be a royal offspring, that are destined to sit upon a throne?
