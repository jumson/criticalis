There is also in them a close community of subject. The fear of God is the corner-stone of all blessedness. We must reverence the ever-blessed God before we can be blessed ourselves. Some think that this life is an evil, an infliction, a thing upon which rests a curse; but it is not so; the God-fearing man has a present blessing resting upon him. It is not true that it would be to him &quot; something better not to be.&quot; He is happy now, for he is the child of the happy God, the ever-living Jehovah; and he is even here a joint-heir with Jesus Christ, whose heritage is not misery, but joy. This is true of every one of the God-fearing, of all conditions, in all ages : each one and every one is blessed. Their blessedness may not always be seen by carnal reason, but it is always a fact, for God himself declares that it is so; and we know that those whom he blesses are blessed indeed. Let us cultivate that holy filial fear of Jehovah which is the essence of all true religion ;&#8212;the fear of reverence, of dread to offend, of anxiety to please, and of entire submission and obedience. This fear of the Lord is the fit fountain of holy living: we look in vain for holiness apart from it: none but those who fear the Lord will ever walk in his ways.</p>

Lord if we act like those who have no care whether there be a God or no. God&#39;s ways will be our ways if we have a sincere reverence for him: if the heart is joined unto God, the feet will follow hard after him. A man&#39;s heart will be seen in his walk, and the blessing will come where heart and walk are both with God. Note that the first psalm links the benediction with the walk in a negative way, &quot;Blessed is the man that walketh not,&quot; etc. ; but here we find it in connection with the positive form of our conversation. To enjoy the divine blessing we must be active, and walk; we must be methodical, and walk in certain ways; and we must be godly, and walk in the Lord&#39;s ways. God&#39;s ways are blessed ways; they were cast up by the Blessed One, they were trodden by him in whom we are blessed, they are frequented by the blessed, they are provided with meansof blessing, they are paved with present blessings, and they lead to eternal blessedness: who would not desire to walk in them&#39;&#39;</span></p>

God is the God of labourers. We are not toleave our worldly callings because the Lord has called us by grace : we are not promised a blessing upon romantic idleness or unreasonable dreaming, but upon hard work and honest industry. Though we are in God&#39;s hands we are to be supported by our own hands. He will give us daily bread, but it must be made our own by labour. All kinds of labour are here included; for if one toils by the sweat of his brow, and another does so by the sweat of his brain, there is no difference in the blessing; save that it is generally more healthy to work with the body than with the mind only. Without God it would be vain to labour; but when we are labourers together with God a promise is set before us. The promise is that labour shall be fruitful, and that he who performs it shall himself enjoy the recompense of it. It is a grievous ill for a man to slave his life away and receive no fair remuneration for his toil: as a rule, God&#39;s servants rise out of such bondage and claim their own, and receive it: at any rate, this verse may encourage them to do so. &quot;The labourer is worthy of his hire.&quot; Under the Theocracy the chosen people could see this promise literally fulfilled ; but when evil rulers oppressed them their earnings were withheld by churls, and their harvests were snatched away from them by marauders. Had they walked in the fear of the Lord they would never have known such great evils. Some men never enjoy their labour, for they give themselves no time for rest. Eagerness to get takes from them the ability to enjoy. Surely, if it is worth while to labour, it is worth while to eat of that labour. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Happy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span>ft&#171;,&quot; or, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Oh, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>happinesses. </span>Heaped up happinesses in the plural belong to that man who fears the Lord. He is happy, and he shall be happy in a thousand ways. The context leads us to expect &quot;family happiness. Our God is our household God. The Romans had their Lares and Penates, but we have far more than they in the one only living and true God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>well </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee,&quot; </span>or, <span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee. </span>Yes, good isfor the good; and it shall be well with those who do well.</p>

In God&#39;s view it would not be a blessed thing for us to live without exertion, nor to eat the unearned bread of dependence : the happiest state on earth is one in which we have something to do, strength to do it with, and a fair return for what we have done. This, with the divine blessing, is all that we ought to desire, and it is sufficient for any man who fears the Lord and abhors covetousness. Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.</p>

They come as the lawful fruit of marriage, even as clusters appear upon the vine. For the grapes the vine was planted ; for children was the wife provided. It is generally well with any creature when it fulfils its purpose, and it is so far well with married people when the great design of their union is brought about. They must not look upon fruit fulness as a burden, but as a blessing. Good wives are also fruitful in kindness, thrift, helpfulness, and affection : if they bear no children, they are by no means barren if they yield us the wine of consolation and the clusters of comfort. Truly blessed is the man whose wife is fruitful in those good works which are suitable to her near and dear position.</p>

The Psalmist never intended to suggest the idea of olive plants round a table, but of young people springing up around their parents, even as olive plants surround the fine, well-rooted tree. The figure is very striking, and would be sure to present itself to the mind of every observer in the olive country. How beautiful to see the gnarled olive, still bearing abundant fruit, surrounded with a little band of sturdy successors, any one of which would be able to take its place should the central olive be blown down, or removed in any other way. The notion of a table in a bower may suit a cockney in a tea-garden, but would never occur to an oriental poet; it is not the olive plants, but the children, that are round about the table. Moreover, note that it is not olive <span style='font-style:italic;'>branches, </span>but <span style='font-style:italic;'>plants,</span>&#8212;a very different thing. Our children gather around our table to be fed, and this involves expenses: how much better is this than to see them pining upon beds of sickness, unable to come for their meals! What a blessing to have sufficient to put upon the table! Let us for this benefit praise the bounty of the Lord. The wife is busy all over the house, but the youngsters are busiest at meal-times; and if the blessing of the Lord rest upon the family, no sight can be more delightful. Here we have the vine and the olive blended&#8212;joy from the fruitful wife, and solid comfort from the growing family; these are the choicest products earth can yield : our families are gardens of the Lord. It may help us to value the privileges of our home if we consider where we should be if they were withdrawn. What if the dear partner of our life were removed from the sides of our house to the recesses of the sepulchre? What is the trouble of children compared with the sorrow of their loss? Think, dear father, what would be your grief if you had to cry with Job, &quot;Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; when my children were about me.&quot;</p>

Put a <span style='font-style:italic;'>Nota </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bene </span>against it, for it is worthy of observation. It is not to be inferred that all blessed men are married, and are fathers; but that this is the way in which the Lord favours godly people who are placed in domestic life. He makes their relationships happy and profitable. In this fashion does Jehovah bless God-fearing households, for he is the God of all the families of Israel. We have seen this blessing scores of times, and we have never ceased to admire in domestic peace the sweetest of human felicity. Family blessedness comes from the Lord, and is a part of his plan for the preservation of a godly race, and for the maintenance of his worship in the land. To the Lord alone we must look for it. The possession of riches will not ensure it; the choice of a healthy and beautiful bride will not ensure it; the birth of numerous comely children will not ensure it: there must be the blessing of God, the influence of piety, the result of holy living.</span></p>

The blessing of the house of God shall be upon his house. The priestly benediction which is recorded in Numbers vi. 24&#8212;26, runs thus: &quot;The Lord bless thee, and keep thee : the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.&quot; This is it which shall come upon the head of the God-fearing roan. Zion was the centre of blessing, and to it the people looked when they sought for mercy : from the altar of sacrifice, from the mercy-seat, from the Shekinah-light, yea, from Jehovah himself, the blessing shall come to each one of his holy people. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>see </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jerusalem </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>days </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>life.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>He shall have a patriot&#39;s joy as well as a patriarch&#39;s peace. God shall give him to see his country prosper, and its metropolitan city flourish. When tent-mercies are followed by templemercies, and these are attended by national mercies,&#8212;the man, the worshipper, the patriot is trebly favoured of the Lord. This favour is to be permanent throughout the good man&#39;s life, and that life is to be a long one, for he is to see his sons&#39; sons. Many a time does true religion bring such blessings to men; and when these good things are denied them, they have a greater reward as a compensation.</p>

Men live their young lives over again in their grandchildren. Does not Solomon say that &quot; children&#39;s children are the crown of old men&quot;? So they are. The good man is glad that a pious stock is likely to be continued; he rejoices in the belief that other homes as happy as his own will be built up wherein altars to the glory of God shall smoke with the morning and evening sacrifice. This promise implies long life, and that life rendered happy by its being continued in our offspring. It is one token of the immortality of man that he derives joy from extending his life in the lives of his descendants.</p>

It is a favourite formula. Let God&#39;s own heritage be at peace, and we are all glad of it. We count it our own prosperity for the chosen of the Lord to find rest and quiet. Jacob was sorely tossed about ; his life knew little of peace; but yet the Lord delivered him out of all his tribulations, and brought him to a place of rest in Goshcn for a while, and afterwards to sleep with his fathers in the cave of Machpelah. His glorious Seed was grievously afflicted and at last crucified ; but he has risen to eternal peace, and in his peace we dwell. Israel&#39;s spiritual descendants still share his chequered conditions, but there remains a rest for them also, and they shall have peace from the God of peace. Israel was a prayingpetitioner in the days of his wrestling, but he became a prevailing prince, and therein his soul found peace. Yes, all around it is true&#8212;&quot; Peace upon Israel t Peace upon Israel.&quot;</p>

It enumerates, therefore, at the commencement, as is usual in songs of this kind, all those things which are regarded as burdens in the married life, such as the labours in seeking to provide for the whole family; the spouse, and that marriage bond, which, as it were, binds a man and seems to make him a slave, just as that character says in the comedy, &quot;I have taken a wife; I have sold my liberty:&quot; lastly, the education of the children, which certainly is most laborious, and requires the largest expenditure. To lighten the burden of all these things, there is added to each a blessing or a promise, so that they might appear slight. And at the close, it subjoins in general, a spiritual promise, which easily makes light of all the labours and disquiets of the married life; even if they should be the very heaviest. The blessing comes from Zion or the Church: for there is nothing so burdensome and difficult, but what it can be easily borne by those who are the members of the true Church, and know the sources of true consolation.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>D. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>H. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mollerus. </span></p>

When worldly prudence attempts to choose a wife and form a household, it can apply its hand only to so much of the work as has its seat upon earth, and is visible to the eye of sense. It builds, so to speak, the first and the second story, adds cornice and pediment, and the fabric presents a fair appearance&#8212;but it has no foundation. Whenever you see the household of a married pair continuing to defy every storm, you may be sure that it rests upon a sure foundation, lying beyond the reach of human sense, and that that foundation is <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord. </span>To the fear of the Lord, therefore, the holy Psalmist has wisely given a place in front of this beautiful psalm, which celebrates the blessing that descends upon conjugal and domestic life.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Augmtus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>F. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tholuck, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Hours </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christian </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Devo</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tion,&quot; </span>1870.</p>

Such is the fear of the Christian now: a fear which reverence for majesty, gratitude for mercies, dread of displeasure, desire of approval, and longing for the fellowship of heaven, inspire; the fear of angels and the blessed Son ; the fear not of sorrow but of love, which shrinks with instinctive recoil from doing aught that would tend to grieve, or from denying aught that would tend to honour.

Carnal reason judges either that all mankind without exception are miserable, or that fortune is more favourable to ungodly and wicked men than to the good. To the sentiment that those are blessed who fear the Lord, it has an entire aversion. So much the more requisite, then, is it to dwell upon the consideration of this truth. Farther, as this blessedness is not apparent to the eye, it is of importance, in order to our being able to apprehend it, first to attend to the definition which will be given of it by-and-bye; and secondly, to know that it depends chiefly upon the protection of God. Although we collect together all the circumstances which seem to contribute to a happy life, surely nothing will be found more desirable than to be kept hidden under the guardianship of God. If this blessing is, in our estimation, to be preferred, as it deserves, to all other good things, whoever is persuaded that the care of God is exercised about the world and human affairs, will at the same time unques<a id='GBS.PA49.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.68.1.0.box.250.260.1298.63.q.60'>tionably acknowledge that what is here laid down <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span>the chief point of happiness. &#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></span></p>

For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church&quot; : Ephes. v. 28, 29.</p>

Husbands, therefore, should remember that they ought to behave towards their wives patiently and prudently, as with the weaker vessel; not keeping in mind the fragility of the wood, but the abundance and sweetness of the fruit. If husbands observe this, that will happen to them which Scripture says concerning the peaceful time of Solomon, &quot;And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree&quot; : 1 Kings iv. 25.
