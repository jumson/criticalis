attractive poesy the truth is emphasized by reiteration in other words. Moreover, &#39;God is not only to be praised <span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span>the heights, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>them : the adoration is to be perfected in the heavens from which it takes its rise. No place is too high for the praises of the most High. On the summit of creation the glory of the Lord is to be revealed, even as the tops of the highest Alps are tipped with the golden light of the same sun which glads the valleys. Heavens and heights become the higher and the more heavenly as they are made to resound with the praises of Jehovah. See how the Psalmist trumpets out the word &quot;<span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Praise.&quot; </span>It sounds forth some nine times in the first five verses of this song.

Not one bright spirit is exempted from this consecrated service. However many ye be, O angels, ye are all <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>angels, and therefore ye are bound, all of you, to render service to your Lord. Ye have all seen enough of him to be able to praise him, and ye have all abundant reasons for so doing. Whether ye be named Oabriel, or Michael, or by whatever other titles ye are known, praise ye the Lord. Whether ye bow before him, or fly on his errands, or desire to look into his covenant, or behold his Son, cease nut, ye messengers of Jehovah, to sound forth his praise while ye move at his bidding. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hosts.&#39;&#39; </span>This includes angelic armies, but groups with them all the heavenly bodies.

Let each one of the countless legions of the Lord of hosts show forth his glory; for the countless armies are all <span style='font-style:italic;'>his, </span>his by creation, and preservation, and consequent obligation. Both these sentences claim unanimity of praise from those in the upper regions who are called upon to commence the strain&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ill </span>his Angels, <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>his hosts.&#39;&#39; That same hearty oneness must pervade the whole orchestra of praising ones; hence, further on, we read of all stars of light, all deeps, all hills, all cedars, and all people. How well the concert begins when all angels, and all the heavenly host, strike the first joyful notes! In that concert our souls would at once take their part.</p>

As all, so each, must praise the God of each and all. The sun and moon, as joint rulers of day and night, are paired in praise: the one is the complement of the other, and so they are closely associated in the summons to worship. The sun has his peculiar mode of glorifying the Great Father of lights, and the moon has her own special method of reflecting his brightness. There is a perpetual adoration of the Lord in the skies: it varies with night and day, but it ever continues while sun and moon endure. There is ever a lamp burning before the high altar of the Lord. Nor are the greater luminaries allowed to drown with their floods of light the glory of the lesser brilliants, for all the stars are bidden to the banquet of praise. Stars are many, so many that no one can count the host included under the words, &quot;all ye stars &quot; ; yet no one of them refuses to praise its Maker. From their extreme brilliance they are fitly named &quot; stars of light &quot; ; and this light is praise in a visible form twinkling to true music. Light is song glittering before the eye instead of resounding in the ear. Stars without light would render no praise, and Christians without light rob the Lord of his glory. However small our beam, we must not hide it: if we cannot be sun or moon we must aim to be one of the &quot; stars of light,&quot; and our every twinkling must be to the honour of our Lord.</p>

best of the best are to praise the Lord. If we could climb as much above the heavens as the heavens are above the earth, we could still cry out to all around us, &quot;Praise ye the Lord.&quot; There can be none so great and high as to be above praising Jehovah. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>above </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heavens.&quot; </span>Let the clouds roll tip volumes of adoration.

The name of <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Jehovah </span>is written legibly upon his works, so that his power, wisdom, goodness, and other attributes are therein made manifest to thoughtful men, and thus his name is praised. The highest praise of God is to declare what he is. We can invent nothing which would magnify the Lord: we can never extol him better than by repeating his name, or describing his character. The Lord is to be extolled as creating all things that exist, and as doing so by the simple agency of his word. He created by a command; what a power is this! Well may he expect those to praise him who owe their being to him. Evolution may be atheistic; but the doctrine of creation logically demands worship; and hence, as the tree is known by its fruit, it proves itself to be true. Those who were created by command are under command to adore their Creator. The voice which said &quot;Let them be,&quot; now saith &quot; Let them praise.&quot;</p>

They do not fail because the Lord does not fail them. Without his will these things cannot alter; he has impressed upon them laws which only he himself can change. Eternally his ordinances are binding upon them. Therefore ought the Lord to be praised because he is Preserver as well as Creator, Ruler as well as Maker. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>decree </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pass.&quot; </span>The heavenly bodies are ruled by Jehovah&#39;s decree: they cannot pass his limit, or trespass against his law. His rule and ordination can never be changed except by himself, and in this sense his decree &quot;shall not pass &quot; : moreover, the highest and most wonderful of creatures are perfectly obedient to the statutes of the Great King, and thus his decree is not passed over. This submission to law is praise. Obedience is homage; order is harmony. In this respect the praise rendered to Jehovah from the &quot; bodies celestial &quot; is absolutely perfect. His almighty power upholds all things in their spheres, securing the march of stars and the flight of seraphs; and thus the music of the upper regions is never marred by discord, nor interrupted by destruction. The eternal hymn is for ever chanted; even the solemn silence of the spheres is a perpetual psalm.</p>

About &quot;dragons&quot; and &quot;deeps&quot; there is somewhat of dread, but this may the more fitly become the bass of the music of the psalm.

Varieties in the landscape are produced by the rising and falling of the soil, and by the many kinds of trees which adorn the land: let all, and all alike, glorify their one Lord. When the trees clap their hands in the wind, or their leaves rustle in the gentle breath of Zephyr, they do to their best ability sing out unto the Lord.</p>

No one can become familiar with insect and bird life without feeling that they constitute a wonderful chapter in the history of divine wisdom. The minute insect marvellously proclaims the Lord&#39;s handiwork : when placed under the microscope it tells a wondrous tale. So, too, the bird which soars aloft displays in its adaptation for an aerial life an amount of skill which our balloonists have in vain attempted to emulate. True devotion not only hears the praises of God in the sweet song of feathered minstrels, but even discovers it in the croaking from the marsh, or in the buzz of &quot;the blue fly which singeth in the window-pane.&quot; More base than reptiles, more insignificant than insects, are songless men.</p>

Those who lead in battle and those who decide in courts must neither of them allow their vocations to keep them from reverently adoring the Chief and Judge of all. All people, and all judges, must praise the Lord of all. What a happy day it will be when it is universally acknowledged that through our Lord Jesus, the incarnate Wisdom, &quot;kings reign and princes decree justice &quot;! Alas, it is not so as yet! kings have been patrons of vice, and princes ringleaders in folly. Let us pray that the song of the Psalmist may be realized in fact.</p>

There is room for every voice at this concert: fruitful trees and maidens, cedars and young men, angels and children, old men and judges&#8212;all may unite in this oratorio.

When they are brought low he raises up a horn for them by sending them a deliverer; when they are in conflict he gives them courage and strength, so that they lift up their horn amid the fray; and when all is peaceful around them, he fills their horn with plenty, and they lift it up with delight. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saints.&#39;&#39; </span>He is their glory: to him they render praise ; and he by his mercy to them evermore gives them further reasons for praise, and higher motives for adoration.

This is a highly honourable description of the beloved race; and it is true even more emphatically of the spiritual Israel, the believing seed. This nearness should prompt us to perpetual adoration. The Lord&#39;s elect are the children of his love, the courtiers of his palace, the priests of his temple, and therefore they are bound beyond all others to be filled with reverence for him, and delight in him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord,&quot; </span>or, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Hallelujah. </span>This should be the Alpha and Omega of a good man&#39;s life. Let us praise God to the end, world without end. The field of praise which lies before us in this psalm is bounded at beginning and end by landmarks in the form of Hallelujahs, and all that lieth between them is every word of it to the Lord&#39;s honour. Amen.</p>

This psalm is the expression of the loftiest devotion, and it embraces at the same time the most comprehensive view of the relation of the creature to the Creator. Whether it is exclusively the utterance of a heart filled to the full with the thought of the infinite majesty of God, or whether it is also an anticipation, a prophetic forecast, of the final glory of creation, when at the manifestation of the sons of God, the creation itself also shall be redeemed from the bondage of corruption (Rom. viii. 18&#8212;23), and the homage of praise shall indeed be rendered by all things that are in heaven and earth and under the earth, is a question into which we need not enter.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stewart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Perowne. </span></p>

I have stood oa a winter day and seen the tiny flakes in little clouds lose themselves one by one in the rushing river. They seemed to die to no purpose&#8212;to be swallowed up by an enemy which ignored both their power and their existence. And so have I seen the Word of God fall upon human hearts. Sent of God, from day to day and from year to year, I have seen it dropping apparently all resultless into the fierce current of unbelief&#8212;into the fiercer gulf-stream of worldliness which was sweeping through the min&#39;ds and the lives of the hearers. But as I stood upon the river&#39;s bank and looked upon what seemed to be the death of the little fluttering crystal, a second thought assured me that it was but death into life, and that every tiny flake which wept its live away in the rushing waters, became incorporate with the river&#39;s being. So when I have seen the Word of God fall apparently fruitless upon the restless, seething, rushing current of human life, a recovered faith in the immutable declaration of God has assured me that what I looked upon was not a chance or idle death, but rather the falling of the soldier, after that he had wrought his life-force into the destiny of a nation and into the history of a world.

It is beautiful in calm, when the tree-tops scarce whisper to each other, and the twitter of the golden wren sounds loud in the expectant hush; it is more than beautiful in storm, when the wild fingers of the wind play the most mournful music on its great harp-strings, and its full diapason is sublime as the roar of the ocean on a rock-bound shore. I do not wonder that the northern imagination in heathen times should have invested it with awe and fear as the favourite haunt of Odin and Thor; or that, in after times, its long rows of trunks, vanishing in the dim perspective, should have furnished designs for the aisles of Christian temples, and the sunset, burning among its fretted branches, should have suggested the gorgeous painted window of the cathedral. It looks like a place made for worship, all its sentiments and associations seem of a sacred and solemn character. Nature, with folded hands, as Longfellow says, seems kneeling there in prayer. It certainly reminds us in various ways of the power, wisdom, and goodness of him who thus spake by the mouth of his prophet: &quot;I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together: that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, .that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Hugh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Macmittan, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Bible </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Teachings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Nature,&quot; </span>1867.</p>

As all men originally stand upon a level as to condition, the higher persons have risen, and the nearer they have been brought to God, the more sacredly are they bound to proclaim his goodness. The more intolerable is the wickedness of kings and princes who claim exemption from the common rule, when they ought rather to inculcate it upon others, and lead the way. He could have addressed his exhortation at once summarily to all men, as indeed he mentions <span style='font-style:italic;'>people </span>in general terms; but by thrice specifying <span style='font-style:italic;'>princes </span>he suggests that they are slow to discharge the duty, and need to be urged to it.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin, </span></p>

First, that the younger sort might desire to praise God, they are exhorted to address themselves to the service of God, to remember their Creator in the days of their youth. Secondly, for aged men, that they might not doubt of the acceptation of their service, our Prophet exhorts them also. For the first, y6u know, David calls upon the sun and the moon to praise God. Should the sun reply, I will not do it in the morning, or at noon time, but when I am about to set? or the moon reply, I will not in Ihe full, but in the wane? or the tree, not in the spring time, or in the summer, but at the fall of the leaf? So likewise, thou young man, defer not the lime of praising God: take the swing of thy youth, and do not defer to apply thyself to the service of God till thy old age; but remember that for all these things thou shalt come to judgment. He that styles himself by the title <span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>AM, </span>cares not for I will be, or I have been, but he that is at this present: take heed, therefore, thou strong and lusty young man : the Devil that holds thee now will every day tie a new cord about thee. Consider this, you that are yet young, whom the morning sun of light adorns with his glorious rays: everyone doth not live to be old. Let us not procrastinate in God&#39;s service ; for the longer we defer to serve God, the farther God&#39;s grace is distant from us, and the dominion of Satan is more strengthened in our hearts; the more we delay, the more is our debt, the greater our sin, and the less our grace. 1 will commend this lesson unto all. He that doth not repent to-day hath a day more to repent of, and a day less to repent in. I shall conclude with a hearty exhortation for us all, of what sex, age, and degree soever; I could wish that all our lives might end like this book of Psalms, in blessing and praising Almighty God.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cheshire, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Saint </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Faitle&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Church,&quot; </span>1641.</p>
