It is not enough for us to praise God ourselves, we are quite unequal to such a work; let us call in all our friends and neighbours, and if they have been slack in such service, let us stir them up to it with loving exhortations. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord.&quot; </span>Let hia character be extolled by you, and let all that he has revealed concerning himself be the subject of your song; for this is truly his <span style='font-style:italic;'>name. </span>Specially let his holy and incommunicable name of &quot;Jehovah&quot; be the object of your adoration. By that name he sets forth his self-existence, and his immutability; let these arouse your praises of his Godhead. Think of him with love, admire him with heartiness, and then extol him with ardour. Do not only magnify the Lord because he is God; but study his character and his doings, and thus render intelligent, appreciative praise. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servants </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord.&quot; </span>If others are silent, you must not be; you must be the first to celebrate his praises. You are &quot;servants,&quot; and this is part of your service; his &quot; name&quot; is named upon you, therefore celebrate his name with praises ; you know what a blessed Master he is, therefore speak well of him. Those who shun his service are sure to neglect his praise; but as grace has made you his own personal servants, let your hearts make you his court-musicians. Here we see the servant of the Lord arousing his fellow-servants by three times calling upon them to praise. Are we, then, so slow in such a sweet employ? Or is it that when we do our utmost it is all too little for such a Lord? Both are true. We do not praise enough; we cannot praise too much.

Should not ministers be celebrated for celebrating the praises of Jehovah? Should not church officers and churchmembers excel all others in the excellent duty of adoration? Should not all of every degree who wait even in his outer courts unite in his worship? Ought not the least and feeblest of his people to proclaim his praises, in company with those who live nearest to him? Is it not a proper thing to remind them of their obligations? Is not the Psalmist wise when he does so in this case and in many others?

Perhaps this is the sweetest word in these two verses. &quot;This God is our God for ever and ever.&quot; &quot;Our God &quot; signifies possession, communion in possession, assurance of possession, delight in possession.

Jacob had then done neither good nor evil, yet thus the Lord determined, and thus he spake. If it be said that the choice was made upon foresight of Jacob&#39;s character, it is, perhaps, even more remarkable; for there was little enough about Jacob that could deserve special choice. By nature Jacob was by no means the most lovable of men. No, it was sovereign grace which dictated the choice.

He says positively, &quot;I know.&quot; It is knowledge worth possessing. He knew by observation, inspiration, and realization; he was no agnostic, he was certain and clear upon the matter.

purpose is not frustrated : in no one point is his good pleasure set aside. The word &quot; whatsoever&quot; is of the widest range and includes all things, and the four words of place which are mentioned comprehend all space; therefore the declaration of the text knows neither limit nor exception. Jehovah works his will : he pleases to do, and he performs the deed. None can stay his hand. How different this from the gods whom the heathen fabled to be subjecjt to all the disappointments, failures, and passions of men! How contrary even to those so-called Christian conceptions of God which subordinate him to the will of man, and make his eternal purposes the football of human caprice. Our theology teaches us no such degrading notions of the Eternal as that he can be baffled by man. &quot;His purpose shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure.&quot; No region is too high, no abyss too deep, no land too distant, no sea too wide for his omnipotence: his divine pleasure travels post over all the realm of nature, and his behests are obeyed.</span></p>

The process of evaporation is passed by unnoticed by the many, because they see it going on all around them; the usual ceases to be wonderful to the thoughtless, but it remains a marvel to the instructed. When we consider upon what an immense scale evaporation is continually going on, and how needful it is for the existence of all life, we may well admire the wisdom and the power which are displayed therein. All around us from every point of the horizon the vapour rises, condenses into clouds, and ultimately descends as rain. Whence the vapours originally ascended from which our showers are formed it would be impossible to tell; most probably the main part of them comes from the tropical regions, and other remote places at &#39;&#39; the ends of the earth.&quot; It is the Lord who causes them to rise, and not a mere law. What is law without a force at the back of it? <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>maketh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lightnings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rain.&quot; </span>There is an intimate connection between lightning and rain, and this would seem to be more apparent in Palestine than even with ourselves; for we constantly read of thunderstorms in that country as attending heavy down-pours of rain. Lightning is not to be regarded as a lawless force, but as a part of that wonderful machinery by which the earth is kept in a fit condition: a force as much under the control of God as any other, a force most essential to our existence. The ever-changing waters, rains, winds, and electric currents circulate as if they were the life-blood and vital spirits of the universe. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bringeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wind </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#171;f </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>treasuries.&quot; </span>This great force which seems left to its own wild will is really under the supreme and careful government of the Lord. As a monarch is specially master of the contents of his own treasure, so is our God the Lord of the tempest and hurricane; and as princes do not spend their treasure without taking note and count of it, so the Lord does not permit the wind to be wasted, or squandered without purpose. Everything in the material world is under the immediate direction and control of the Lord of all. Observe how the Psalmist brings before us the personal action of Jehovah: &quot;he causeth,&quot; &quot;he maketh,&quot; &quot;he bringeth.&quot; Everywhere the Lord worketh all things, and there is no power which escapes his supremacy. It is well for us that it is so: one bandit force wandering through the Lord&#39;s domains defying his control would cast fear and trembling over all the provinces of providence. Let us praise Jehovah for the power and wisdom with which he rules clouds, and lightnings, and winds, and all other mighty and mysterious agencies.</p>

Even in plagues he is to be seen, as truly as in mercies. The plagues were not only terrible wonders which astounded men, but forcible tokens or signs by which they were instructed. No doubt the plagues were aimed at the various deities of the Egyptians, and were a grand exposure of their impotence; each one had its own special significance. The judgments of the Lord were no side blows, they struck the nation at the heart; he sent his bolts &quot; into the midst of thee, O Egypt!&quot; These marvels happened in the centre of the proud and exclusive nation of Egypt, which thought itself iar superior to other lands; and many of these plagues touched the nation in points upon which it prided itself. The Psalmist addresses that haughty nation, saying, &quot;O Egypt,&quot; as though reminding it of the lessons which it had been taught by the Lord&#39;s right hand. Imperious Pharaoh had been the ringleader in defying Jehovah, and he was made personally to smart for it; nor did his flattering courtiers escape, upon each one of them the scourge fell heavily. God&#39;s servants are far better off than Pharaoh&#39;s servants: those who stand in the courts of Jehovah are delivered, but the courtiers of Pharaoh &#187;re smitten all of them, for they were all partakers in his evil deeds. The Lord is to be praised for thus rescuing his own people, and causing their cruel adversaries to bite the dust. Let no true Israelite forget the song of the Red Sea, but anew let us hear a voice summoning us to exulting praise: &quot;Sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously.&quot;</p>

He is prepared to mete out vengeance to those who oppose bis designs : those who dream of him as too tender to come to blows have mistaken the God of Israel. Ue intended to bless the world through his chosen people, and he would not be turned from his purpose: cost what it might, he would preserve the candle of truth which he had lighted, even though the blood of nations should be spilt in its defence.

Often does it happen when they slay a sin or conquer a difficulty that they are enriched by the spoil : to them even evils work for good, and trials ensure triumphs.

Though silver and gold are useful to us when we rightly employ them, there is nothing about them which can entitle them to reverence and worship. If we did not know the sorrowful fact to be indisputable, it would seem to be impossible that intelligent beings could bow down before substances which they must themselves refine from tho ore, and fashion into form. One would think it less absurd to worship one&#39;s own hands than to adore that which those hands have made. What great works can these mock deities perform for man when they are themselves the works of man? Idols are titter to be played with, like dolls by babes, than to be adored by grown-up men.
