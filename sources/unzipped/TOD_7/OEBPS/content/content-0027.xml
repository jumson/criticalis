The depths usually silence all they engulf, but they could not close the mouth of this servant of the Lord; on the contrary, it was in the abyss itself that he cried unto Jehovah. Beneath the floods prayer lived and struggled; yea, above the roar of the billows rose the cry of faith. It little matters where we are if we can pray; but prayer is never more real and acceptable than when it rises out of the worst places. Deep places beget deep devotion. Depths of earnestness are stirred by depths of tribulation. Diamonds sparkle most amid the darkness. Prayer <span style='font-style:italic;'>deprofandis </span>gives to God <span style='font-style:italic;'>gloria, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>excelsis. </span>The more distressed we are, the more excellent is the faith which trusts bravely in the Lord, aud therefore appeals to him, and to him alone. Good men may be in the depths of temporal and spiritual trouble; but good men in such cases look only to thenGod, and they stir themselves up to be more instant and earnest in prayer than at other times. The depth of their distress moves the depths of their being; and from the bottom of their hearts an exceeding great and bitter cry rises unto the one living and true God. David had often been in the deep, and as often had he=<a id='GBS.PA67.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.86.1.0.box.252.262.1303.250.q.60'>
pleaded with Jehovah, his God, In whose hand are all deep places. He prayed, and remembered that he had prayed, and pleaded that he had prayed; hoping ere long to receive an answer. It would be dreadful to look back on trouble and feel forced to own that we did not cry unto the Lord in it; but it is most comforting to know that whatever we did not do, or could not do, yet we did pray, even in our worst times. He that prays in the depth will not sink out of his depth. He that cries out of the depths shall soon sing in the heights.</span></p>

If the Lord will but hear us we will leave it to his superior wisdom to decide whether he will answer us or no. It is better for our prayer to be heard than answered. If the Lord were to make an absolute promise to answer all our requests it might be rather a curse than a blessing, for it would be casting the responsibility of our lives upon ourselves, and we should be placed in a very anxious position: but now the Lord hears our desires, and that is enough; we only wish him to grant them if his infinite wisdom sees that it would be for our good and for his glory. Note that the Psalmist spoke audibly in prayer: this is not at all needful, but it is exceedingly helpful; for the use of the voice assists the thoughts. Still, there is a voice in silent supplication, a voice in our weeping, a voice in that sorrow which cannot find a tongue : that voice the Lord will hear if its cry is meant for his ear. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ears </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>attentive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>voice </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>suppliai</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tion.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>The Psalmist&#39;s cry is a beggar&#39;s petition; he begs the great King and Lord to lend an ear to it. He has supplicated many times, but always with one voice, or for one purpose; and he begs to be noticed in the one matter which he has pressed with so much importunity. He would have the King hearken, consider, remember, and weigh his request. He is confused, and his prayer may therefore be broken, and difficult to understand; he begs therefore that his Lord will give the more earnest and compassionate heed to the voice of his many and painful pleadings. When we have already prayed over our troubles it is well to pray over our prayers. If we can find no more words, let us entreat the Lord to hear those petitions which we have already presented. If we have faithfully obeyed the precept by praying without ceasing, we may be confident that the Lord will faithfully fulfil the promise by helping us without fail. Though the Psalmist was under a painful sense of sin, and so was in the depth, his faith pleaded in the teeth of conscious unworthiness; for well he knew that the Lord&#39;s keeping his promise depends upon his own character and not upon that of his erring creatures.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA67.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.86.1.2.box.255.1538.1305.735.q.60'>3. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;If </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou, </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Loud, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shovldest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mark </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquities, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shatt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stand</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>?&quot; </span>If <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Jah, </span>the all-seeing, should in strict justice call every man to account for every want of conformity to righteousness, where would any one of us be? Truly, he does record all our transgressions; but as yet he does not act upon the record, but lays it aside till another day. If men were to be judged upon no system but that of works, who among us could answer for himself at the Lord&#39;s bar, and hope to stand clear and accepted? This verse shows that the Psalmist was under a sense of sin, and felt it imperative upon him not only to cry as a suppliant but to confess as a sinner. Here he owns that he cannot stand before the great King in his own righteousness, and he is so struck with a sonse of the holiness of God, and the rectitude of the law that he is convinced that no man of mortal race can answer for himself before a Judge so perfect, concerning a law so divine. Well does he cry, &quot;O Lord, who shall stand?&quot; None cnn do so: there is none that doeth good ; no, not one. Iniquities are matters which are not according to equity: what a multitude we have of these! Jehovah, who sees all, and is also our <span style='font-style:italic;'>Adonai, </span>or Lord, will assuredly bring us into judgment concerning those thoughts, and words, and works which are not in exact conformity to his law. Were it not for the Lord Jesus, could we hope to stand? Dare we meet him in the dread day of account on the footing of law and equity? What a mercy it is that we need not do so, for the next verse sets forth another way of acceptance to which we flee.</p>

Because his nature is mercy, and because he has provided a sacrifice for sin, therefore forgiveness is with him for all that come to him confessing their sins. The power of pardon is permanently resident with God: he has forgiveness ready to his hand at this instant. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mayest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>feared.&quot; </span>This is the fruitful root of piety. None fear the Lord like those who have experienced his forgiving love. Gratitude for pardon produces far more fear and reverence of God than all the dread which is inspired by punishment. If the Lord were to execute justice upon all, there would be none left to fear him ; if all were under apprehension of his deserved wrath, despair would harden them against fearing him: it is grace which leads the way to a holy regard of God, and a fear of grieving him.</span></p>

For God I wait and for him only : if he will manifest himself I shall have nothing more to wait for; but until he shall appear for my help I must wait on, hoping even in the depths. This waiting of mine is no mere formal act, my very soul is in it,&#8212;&quot; my soul doth wait.&quot; I wait and I wait&#8212;mark the repetition! &quot;My soul waits,&quot; and then again, &quot;My soul waits&quot; ; to make sure work of the waiting. It is well to deal with the Lord intensely. Such repetitions are the reverse of vain repetitions. If the Lord Jehovah makes us wait, let us do so with our whole hearts; for blessed are all they that wait for him. He is worth waiting for. The waiting itself is beneficial to us: it tries faith, exercises patience, trains submission, and endears the blessing when it comes. The Lord&#39;s people have always been a waiting people: they waited for the First Advent, and now they wait for the Second. They waited for a sense of pardon, and now they wait for perfect sanctificntios. They waited in the depths, and they are not now wearied with waiting in a happier condition. They have cried and they do wait; probably their past prayer sustains their present patience.</p>

Those who do not hope cannot wait; but if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. God&#39;s word is a true word, but at times it tarries; if ours is true faith it will wait the Lord&#39;s time. A word from the Lord is as bread to the soul of the believer; and, refreshed thereby, it holds out through the night of sorrow expecting the dawn of deliverance and delight. Waiting, we study the word, believe the word, hope in the word, and live on the word; and all because it is &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>word,&quot;&#8212;the word of him who never speaks in vain. Jehovah&#39;s word is a firm ground for a waiting soul to rest upon.</p>

Worshippers tarrying for the morning sacrifice, the kindling of the incense and the lighting of the lamps, mingle fervent prayers with their holy vigils, and pine for the hour when the lamb shall smoke upon the altar. David, however, waited more than these, waited longer, waited more longingly, waited more expectantly. He was not afraid of the great Adonai before whom none can stand in their own righteousness, for he had put on the righteousness of faith, and therefore longed for gracious audience with the Holy One. God was no more dreaded by him than light is dreaded by those engaged in a lawful calling. He pined and yearned after his God. &quot;7 <span style='font-style:italic;'>say, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>more </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>watch </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>morning.&quot; </span>Tho figure was not strong enough, though one can hardly think of anything more vigorous: he felt that his own eagerness was unique and unrivalled. Oh to be thus hungry and thirsty after God! Our version spoils the abruptness of the language; the original runs thus&#8212;&quot; My soul for the Lord more than those watching for the morning&#8212;watching for the morning.&quot; This is a fine poetical repeat. We long for the favour of the Lord more than weary sentinels long for the morning light which will release them from their tedious watch. Indeed this is true. He that has once rejoiced in communion with God is sore tried by the hidings of his face, and grows faint with strong desire for the Lord&#39;s appearing,</p>

What one Israelite does he wishes all Israel to do. That man has a just right to exhort others who is himself setting the example. Israel of old waited upon Jehovah and wrestled all the night long, and at last he went his way succoured by the Hope of Israel: the like shall happen to all his seed. God has great things in store for his people; they ought to have large expectations. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy.&quot; </span>This is in his very nature, and by the light of nature it may be seen. But we have also the light of grace, and therefore we see still more of his mercy. With us there is sin; but hope is ours, because &quot; with the Lord there is mercy.&quot; Our comfort lies not in that which is with us, but in that which is with our God. Let us look out of self and its poverty to Jehovah and his riches of mercy. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>plenteous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>redemption.&quot; </span>He can and will redeem all his people out of their many and great troubles; nay, their redemption is already wrought out and laid up with him, so that he can at any time give his waiting ones the full benefit thereof. The attribute of mercy, and the fact of redemption, are two most sufficient reasons for hoping in Jehovah; and the fact that there is no mercy or deliverance elsewhere should effectually wean the soul from all idolatry. Are not these deep things of God a grand comfort for those who are crying out of the depths? Is it not better to be in the deeps with David, hoping in God&#39;s mercy, than up on the mountain-tops, boasting in our own fancied righteousness?</p>

What a blessing that this is here promised in terms which remove it out of the region of question: the Lord shall certainly redeem his believing people from all their sins. Well may the redemption be plenteous since it concerns all Israel and all iniquities! Truly, our psalm has ascended to a great height in this verse: this is no cry out of the depths, but a chorale in the heights. Redemption is the top of covenant blessings. When it shall be experienced by all Israel, the latter-day glory shall have come, and the Lord&#39;s people shall say, &quot;Now, Lord, what wait we for?&quot; Is not this a clear prophecy of the coming of our Lord Jesus the first time? and may we not now regard it as the promise of his second and more glorious coming for the redemption of the body? For this our soul doth wait: yea, our heart and our flesh cry out for it with joyful expectation.</p>

But leaving the buffooneries of the Papists we will rather consider the true meaning and use of the psalm.

In the course of the conversation, Dr. Owen put the question, &quot;Young man, pray in what manner do you think to go to God?&quot; &quot;Through the Mediator, sir,&quot; answered Mr. Davis. &quot;That is easily said,&quot; replied the doctor, &quot; but I assure you it is another thing to go to God through the Mediator than many who make use of the expression are siware of. I myself preached Christ,&quot; he continued, &quot;some years, when I had but very little, if any, experimental acquaintance with access to God through Christ; until the Lord was pleased to visit me with sore affliction, whereby I was brought to the mouth of the grave, and under which my soul was oppressed with horror and darkness; but God graciously relieved my spirit by a powerful application of Psalm cxxx. 4, &#39;<span style='font-style:italic;'>But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forgiveness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mayest </span>6&#171; <span style='font-style:italic;'>feared,&#39; </span>from whence I received special instruction, peace and comfort, in drawing near to God through the Mediator, and preached thereupon immediately after my recovery.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>H. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goold, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>editor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Owen?</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Collected </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Works, </span>1851.</p>

Afflictions are compared to deep waters. Ps. xviii. 16: &quot;He drew mo out of many waters.&quot; &quot;Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul.&quot; And surely God&#39;s children are often cast into very desperate cases, and plunged into deep miseries, to the end that they may send out of a contrite and feeling heart such prayers as may mount aloft and pierce the heavens. When we are in prosperity our prayers come from our lips; and therefore the Lord is forced to cast us down, that our prayers may come from our hearts, and that our senses may be wakened from the security in which they are lying. Albeit the throne of God be most high, yet he delighteth to hear the petition of hearts that are most low, that are most cast down by the sight of sin. There is no affliction, neither any place so low (yea, if as low as the belly of the whale wherein Jonah lay) which can separate us from the love of the Lord, or stay our prayers from coming before him. Those that are farthest cast down are not farthest from God, but are nearest unto him. God is near to a contrite heart, and it is the proper seat where his Spirit dwelleth : Isa. Ixvi. 2. And thus God dealeth with us, as men do with such houses that they are minded to build sumptuously and on high; for then they dig deep grounds for the foundation. Thus God purposing to make a fair show of Daniel, and the three children in Babel; of Joseph in Egypt; of David in Israel; he first threw them into the deep waters of affliction. Daniel is cast into the den of lions; the three children are thrown into the fiery furnace; Joseph is imprisoned; David exiled. Yet all those he exalted and made glorious temples to himself. Mark hereby the dulness of our nature, that is such, that God is forced to use sharp remedies to awaken us. Jonah lay sleeping in the ship, when the tempest of God&#39;s wrath was pursuing him: God therefore threw him into the belly of the whale, and the bottom of the deep, that from those deep places he might cry to him.</p>

Unless we fear, he may choose whether he will be merciful or no ; or rather, we may be sure he will not be merciful, seeing he hath mercy for none but for them that fear him; and there is great reason for this, for to whom should mercy show itself but to them that need it ? and if we think we need it we will certainly fear.

Nothing will bear us up but hope. <span style='font-style:italic;'>8pero </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>meliora. </span>What encourageth husbandmen and mariners against the surges and waves of the sea, and evil weather, but hope of better times? What comforteth a sick man in time of sickness, but hope of health? or a poor man in his distress, but hope of riches? or a prisoner, but hope of liberty? or a banished man, but hope to come home? All these hopes may fail, as oftentimes wanting a warrant. Albeit a physician may encourage a sick man by his fair words, yet he cannot give him an assurance of his recovery, for his health dependeth on God: friends and courtiers may promise poor men reliaf, but all men are liars; only God is faithful who hath promised. Therefore let us fix our faith on God, and our hope in God; for he will stand by his promise.

Let others, therefore, wait upon the world, wait for the world; I, O God, will wait upon thee, for thee, seeing I find more true contentment in this waiting than all the world can give me in enjoying; for how can I doubt of receiving reward by my waiting for thee when my waiting for thee is itself the reward of my waiting upon thee? And therefore my soul waiteth; for if my soul did not wait, what were my waiting worth? no more than I were worth myself, if I had not a soul; but my soul puts a life into my waiting, and makes it become a living sacrifice. Alas, my frail body is very unfit to make a waiter: it rather needs to be waited upon itself : it must have so much resting, so often leave to be excused from waiting, that if God should have no other waiters than bodies, he would be left oftentimes to wait upon himself; but my soul is <span style='font-style:italic;'>Divina </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>particula </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>aura </span>[a portion of the Divine breath], endued with all qualities .fit for a waiter; and hath it not received its abilities, O God, from thee?

Luke vii. 47-8. 1 John ii. 12. II. The reason of it. 1. In God&#39;s nature there is the desire to forgive; the gift of Christ is sufficient evidence for it. 2. But, the text speaks not so much of a desire as it asserts the existence of a forgiveness being &quot; with&quot; God, therefore ready to be dispensed. The blood of Christ is the reason (Col. i. 14); by it the disposition to forgive righteously manifests itself in the forgiving act: llom. iii. 25, 26. 3. Hence, forgiveness for all who believe is sure: Rom. iii. 25; 1 John ii. 1, 2. III. The result of its realization: &quot;That thou mayest be feared &quot; : with a reverential fear, and spiritual worship. 1. The possibility of forgiveness begets in an anxious soul true penitence, as opposed to terror and despair. 2. The hope of receiving it begets earnest seeking and prayerfulness. 3.
