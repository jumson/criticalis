We have a sufficient audience when we speak with the Lord, and we may say to him many things which were not proper for the ears of men. The holy man makes his appeal to Jehovah, who alone knows the heart: a man should be slow to do this upon any matter, for the Lord is not to be trifled with ; and when anyone ventures on such an appeal he should be sure of his case. He begins with his heart, for that is the centre of our nature, and if pride be there it defiles everything ; just as mire in the spring causes mud in all the streams. It is a grand thing for a man to know his own heart so as to be able to speak before the Lord about it. It is beyond all things deceitful and desperately wicked, who can know it? Who can know it unless taught by the Spirit of God? It is a still greater thing if, upon searching himself thoroughly, a man can solemnly protest unto the Omniscient One that his heart is not haughty: that is to say, neither proud in his opinion of himself, contemptuous to others, nor self-righteous before the Lord ; neither boastful of the past, proud of the present, nor ambitious for the future. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Nor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eyes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lofty.&quot; </span>What the heart desires the eyes look for. Where the desires run the glances usually follow. This holy man felt that he did not seek after elevated places where he might gratify his self-esteem, neither did he look down upon others as being his inferiors. A proud look the Lord hates; and in this all men are agreed with him; yea, even the proud themselves hate haughtiness in the gestures of others. Lofty eyes are so generally hateful that haughty men have been known to avoid the manners natural to the proud in order to escape the ill-will of their fellows. The pride which apes humility always takes care to cast its eyes downward, since every man&#39;s consciousness tells him that contemptuous glances are the sure ensigns of a boastful spirit. In Psalm cxxi. David lifted up his eyes to the hills; but here he declares that they were not lifted up in any other sense. When the heart is right, and the eyes are right, the whole man is on the road to a healthy<a id='GBS.PA87.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.106.1.0.box.299.249.1302.105.q.60'>
and happy condition. Let us take care that we do not use the language of this psalm unless, indeed, it be true as to ourselves; for there is no worse pride than that which claims humility when it does not possess it.</span></p>

As a thoughtful man he did not pry into things unrevealed ; he was not speculative, self-conceited or opinionated. As a secular person he did not thrust himself into the priesthood as Saul had done before him, and as Uzziah did after him. It is well so to exercise ourselves unto godliness that we know our true sphere, and diligently keep to it. Many through wishing to be great have failed to be good : they were not content to adorn the lowly stations which the Lord appointed them, and so they have rushed at grandeur and power, and found destruction where they looked for honour. &quot;Or <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>too </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>high </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>High things may suit others who are of greater stature, and yet they may be quite unfit for us. A man does well to know his own size. Ascertaining his own capacity, he will be foolish if he aims at that which is beyond his reach, straining himself, and thus injuring himself. Such is the vanity of many men that if a work be within their range they despise it, and think it beneath them: the only service which they are willing to undertake is that to which they have never been called, and for which they are by no means qualified. What a haughty heart must he have who will not serve God at all unless he may be trusted with five talents at the least! His looks are indeed lofty who disdains to be a light among his poor friends and neighbours here below, but demands to be created a star of the first magnitude to shine among the upper ranks, and to be admired by gazing crowds. It is just on God&#39;s part that those who wish to be everything should end in being nothing. It is a righteous retribution from God when every matter turns out to be too great for the man who would only handle great matters, and everything proves to be too high for the man who exercised himself in things too high for him. Lord, make us lowly, keep us lowly, fix us for ever in lowliness. Help us to be in such a case that the confession of this verse may come from our lips as a truthful utterance which we dare, make before the Judge of all the earth.</p>

The Psalmist had been upon his best behaviour, and had smoothed down the roughnesses of his self-will; by holy effort he had mastered his own spirit, so that towards God he was not rebellious, even as towards man he was not haughty. It is no easy thing to quiet yourself: sooner may a man calm the sea, or rule the wind, or tame a tiger, than quiet himself. We are clamorous, uneasy, petulant; and nothing but grace can make us quiet under affliction!), irritations, and disappointments. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>As </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>child </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>weaned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mother.&#39;&#39; </span>He had become as subdued and content as a child whose weaning is fully accomplished. The Easterns put off the time of weaning far later than we do, and we may conclude that the process grows none the easier by being postponed. At last there must be an end to the suckling period, and then a battle begins: the child is denied his comfort, and therefore frets and worries, flies into pets, or sinks into sulks. It is facing its first great sorrow, and it is in sore distress. Yet time brings not only alleviations, but the ending of the conflict; the boy ere long is quite content to find his nourishment at the table with his brothers, and he feels no lingering wish to return to those dear fountains from which he once sustained his life. He is no longer angry with his mother, but buries his head in that very bosom after which he pined so grievously: he is weaned <span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span>his mother rather <span style='font-style:italic;'>th&amp;nfrom </span>her.</p>

It is a blessed mark of growth out of spiritual infancy when we can forego the joys which once appeared to be essential, and can find our solace in him who denies them to us : then we behave manfully, and every childish complaint is hushed. If the Lord removes our dearest delight we bow to his will without a murmuring thought; in fact, we find a delight in giving up our delight. This is no spontaneous fruit of nature, but a well-tended product of divine grace: it grows out of humility and lowliness, and it is the stem upon which peace blooms as a fair flower. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ag </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>weaned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>child</span>&quot;; or it may be read, &quot;as a weaned child on me my soul,&quot; as if his soul leaned upon him in mute submission, neither boasting nor complaining. It is not every child of God who arrives at this weanedness speedily. Some are sucklings when they ought to be fathers; others are hard to wean, and cry, and fight, and rage against theii heavenly parent&#39;s discipline. When we think ourselves safely through the weaning, we sadly discover that the old appetites are rather wounded than slain, and we begin crying again for the breasts which we had given up. It is easy to begin shouting before we are out of the wood, and no doubt hundreds have sung this psalm long before they have understood it. Blessed are those afflictions which subdue our affections, which wean us from self-sufficiency, which educate us into Christian manliness, which teach us to love God not merely when he comforts us, but even when he tries us. Well might the sacred poet repeat his figure of the weaned child ; it is worthy of admiration and imitation; it is doubly desirable and difficult of attainment. Such weanedness from self springs from the gentle humility declared in the former verse, and partly accounts for its existence. If pride is gone, submission will be sure to follow; and, on the other hand, if pride is to be driven out, self must also be vanquished.</p>

How he prizes the grace of hope! He has given up the things which are seen, and therefore he values the treasures which are not seen except by the eyes of hope. There is room for the largest hope when self is gone, ground for eternal hope when transient things no Jonger hold the mastery of our spirits. This verse is the lesson of experience: a man of God who had been taught to renounce the world and live upon the Lord alone, here exhorts all his friends and companions to do the same. He found it a blessed thing to live by hope, and therefore he would have all his kinsmen do the same. Let all the nation hope, let all their hope be in Jehovah, let them at once begin hoping &quot; from henceforth,&quot; and let them continue hoping &quot;for ever.&quot; Weaning takes the child out of a temporary condition into a state in which he will continue for the rest of his life: to rise above the world is to enter upon a heavenly existence which can never end. When we cease to hanker for the world we begin hoping in the Lord. O Lord, as a parent weans a child, so do thou wean me, and then shall I fix all my hope on thee alone.</p>

Forgiveness <span style='font-style:italic;'>should </span>humble us. Forgiveness implies sin; and should not the sinner clothe himself with humility? and when not for any desert of his, but simply by the free grace of Heaven, his sins have been pardoned, should he not bind the garments of humility still more closely about him? The man who is of a nature at once sincere and sweet, will be even more humbled by the sense of an undeserved forgiveness than by the memory of the sins from which it has cleansed him. Very fitly, therefore, does the psalm of humility follow the psalm which sings of the Divine loving-kindness and tender mercy.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cox. </span></p>

It is exactly in the spirit of that humble thanksgiving made by him, after the divine revelation by Nathan of the future blessings of his posterity (1 Chron. xxii. 9&#8212;11) ; and forms a most appropriate introduction to the following psalm, the theme of which is evidently the dedication of the Temple.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jebb. </span></p>

If I have anything, it is from thee; it is thy providence which brought me from fi Ilowing the ewes great with young to feed and govern thy people.&quot; Such a holy man would not rashly invoke God, and take his holy name in vain ; but knowing his integrity, durst call God to witness. The saints are wont to d&#39;i so upon like occasions; as Peter (John xxi. 17); &quot;Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.&quot; They know they have a God that will not be deceived with any shows, and that he knoweth and approveth them for such as he findeth them to be.</p>

From those that are affected like David, God will accept the appeal; for in the account of God we are that which we sincerely desire and endeavour to be, and that which is the general course and tenor of our lives, though there be some intermixture of failing.

His profession respecteth his sincere purpose and constant endeavour, and the predominant disposition of his soul. God himself confirmeth such appeals by his own testimony: 1 Kings xv. 5, &quot;My servant David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, neither departed from all that which he had commanded him, save only in the matter of Uriah.&quot; .... By all this it is shown that the plea of sincerity is allowed by God, though there be some mixture of failings and weaknesses.</p>

Luke xviii. 9, &quot;God, I thank thee, I am not like other men.&quot; If David were thus humble, why doth he speak of it? Is he not guilty of pride while he seemeth to speak against pride?</p>

28, &#39;&#39; I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.&quot; If his brother would calumniate his actions, much more might others. Now it is for the honour of God that his children, as they would not commit a fault, so they should not be under the suspicion of it; therefore he appealeth to God. 2. A necessary instruction; for whatsoever David said or wrote here, he said or wrote by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that Israel may learn how to hope in God. Herein David is a notable pattern of duty both to superiors and inferiors.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Manton. </span></span></p>

What a world of meaning is sometimes concentrated in a single glance! But of all the passions, pride is most clearly revealed in the eyes. There can scarcely be <span style='font-style:italic;'>&amp; </span>mistake here. We are all familiar with a class of phrases, which run in pairs. We speak of sin and misery; holiness and happiness; peace and prosperity ; war and desolation. Among these may be numbered, the proud heart and the haughty look. &quot;There is a generation, Oh, how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.&quot; &quot;Him that hath an high look and a proud heart I will not suffer.&quot; ... A proud look is one of the seven things which are an abomination unto the Lord. It is said of him, &quot;Thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down high looks.&quot; And hence David makes the acknowledgment: Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that pride has no existence in my heart.

Self-sufficiency, self-will, self-seeking. From creatures and the things of the world&#8212;not, indeed, as to their use, but as to any dependence upon them for his happiness and portion. . . . Yet this experience is no easy attainment. The very form of expression&#8212;&quot; I have behaved and <span style='font-style:italic;'>quieted </span>myself,&quot; reminds us of some risings which were with difficulty subdued. There is a difference here between Christ and Christians. In him the exercise of grace encountered no adverse principles; but in them it meets with constant opposition. The flesh lusteth against the spirit; and when we would do good evil is present with us; hence the warfare within. So it is with &quot; the child that is weaned.&quot; The task to the mother is trying and troublesome. The infant cries, and seems to sob out his heart. He thinks it very hard in her, and knows not what she means by her seeming cruelty, and the mother&#39;s fondness renders all her firmness necessary to keep her at the process; and sometimes she also weeps at the importunity of his dear looks, and big tears, and stretched-out hands. But it must be done, and therefore, though she pities, she perseveres; and after a while he is soothed and satisfied, forgets the breast, and no longer feels even a hankering after his former pleasure. But how is the weaning of the child accomplished? By embittering the member to his lips; by the removal of the object in the absence and concealment of the mother; by the substitution of other food ; by the influence of time. So it is with us. We love the world, and it deceives us. We depend on creatures, and they fail us, and pierce us through with many sorrows. We enter forbidden paths, and follow after our lovers; and our way is hedged up with thorns; and we then say, &quot; Return unto thy rest, O my soul; and now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.&quot; The enjoyment of a greater good subdues the relish of a less.

So are we to be content with what providence alloweth us: Heb. xiii. 5, &quot;Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as ye have&quot; ; and Phil. iv. 11, &quot;I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.&quot; Whatever pleaseth our heavenly Father should please us. The child that is put from the breast to a harder diet is yet contented at last. The child doth not prescribe what it will eat, drink, or put on. Children are in no care for enlarging possessions, heaping up riches, aspiring after dignities and honours; but meekly take what is provided for them. The child, when it has lost the food which nature provideth for it, is not solicitous, but wholly refcrreth itself to the mother, hangeth upon the mother. So for everything whatsoever should we depend upon God, refer ourselves to God, and expect all things from him: Ps. Ixii. 5, &quot;My soul, wait thou only upon God ; for my expectation is from him.&quot; With such a simplicity of submission should we rest and depend upon God. Let us take heed of being over wise and provident for ourselves, but let us trust our Father which is in heaven, and refer ourselves to his wise and holy government.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Manton. </span></p>

The Targum has it, &quot;as one weaned on the breasts of its mother, I am strengthened in the raw.&quot; This is to be understood not of a child whilst weaning, when it is usually peevish, fretful, and froward, but when it is weaned, and is quiet and easy in its mother&#39;s arms without the breast.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gill. </span></p>

It is one thing to be angry with the world, or ashamed of it, and another to be weaned from it. Alter the world, ennoble it, and many a proud mind that now despises, would court it. It is different also from that weariness of spirit which generally follows a free indulgence in earthly enjoyments. There is such a thing as wearing out the affections. Solomon appears to have done this at one period of his life. &quot;I have not a wish left,&quot; said a well-known sensualist of our own country, who had drunk as deeply as he could drink of the world&#39;s cup. &quot;Were all the earth contains spread out before me, I do not know a thing I would take the trouble of putting out my hand to reach.&quot;</p>

It is not the destruction of its appetite, but the controlling and changing of it. A weaned child still hungers, but it hungers no more after the food that once delighted it; it is quiet without it; it can feed on other things: so a soul weaned from the world, still pants as much as ever for food and happiness, but it no longer seeks them in worldly things, or desires to do so. There is nothing in the world that it feels necessary for its happiness. This thing in it it loves, and that thing it values; but it knows that it can do without them, and it is ready to do without them whenever God pleases.</p>
