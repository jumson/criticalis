My prayer is painful and feeble, and worthy only to be called a cry; but it is a cry unto Jehovah, and this ennobles it. I have cried unto thee, I still cry to thee, and I always mean to cry to thee. To whom else could I go? What else can I do? Others trust to themselves, but I cry unto thee. The weapon of all prayer is one which the believer may always carry with him, and use in every time of need. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Make </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>haste </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>His case was urgent, and he pleaded that urgency. God&#39;s time is the best time, but when we are sorely pressed we may with holy importunity quicken the movements of mercy. In many cases, if help should come late, it would come too late; and we are permitted to pray against such a calamity. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>voice, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&quot; </span>See how a second time he talks of crying: prayer had become his frequent, yea, his constant exercise: twice in a few words he says, &quot;I cry; I cry.&quot; How he longs to be heard, and to be heard at once! There is a voice to the great Father in every cry, and groan, and tear of his children: he can understand what they mean when they are quite unable to express it. It troubles the spirit of the saints when they fear that no favourable ear is turned to their doleful cries: they cannot rest unless their &quot; unto thee &quot; is answered by an &quot; unto me.&quot; When prayer is a man&#39;s only refuge, he is deeply distressed at the bare idea of his failing therein.</p>

it needs to be &quot;set forth&quot; ; what is more, it must be set forth &quot;before the Lord,&#39;&#39; by a sense of his presence and a holy reverence for his name: neither may we regard all supplication as certain of divine acceptance, it needs to be set forth before the Lord &quot; as incense,&quot; concerning the offering of which there were rules to be observed, otherwise it would be rejected of God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lifting </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evening </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sacrifice.&quot; </span>Whatever form his prayer might take his one desire was that it might be accepted of God. Prayer is sometimes presented without words by the very motions of our bodies: bended knees and lifted hands are the tokens of earnest, expectant prayer. Certainly work, or the lifting up of the hands in labour, is prayer if it be done in dependence upon God and for his glory : there is a hand-prayer as well as a heart-prayer, and our desire is that this may be sweet unto the Lord as the sacrifice of eventide. Holy hope, the lifting up of hands that hang down, is also a kind of worship: may it ever be acceptable with God. The Psalmist makes a bold request : he would have his humble cries and prayers to be as much regarded of the Lord as the appointed morning and evening sacrifices of the holy place. Yet the prayer is by no means too bold, for, after all, the spiritual is in the Lord&#39;s esteem higher than the ceremonial, and the calves of the lips are a truer sacrifice than the calves of the stall.</span></p>

David feels that with all his own watchfulness he may be surprised into sin, and so he begs the Lord himself to keep him. When Jehovah sets the watch the city is well guarded: when the Lord becomes the guard of our mouth the whole man is well garrisoned. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&quot;Keep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>door </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lips.&quot; </span>God has made our lips the door of the mouth, but we cannot keep that door of ourselves, therefore do we entreat the Lord to take the rule of it. O that the Lord would both open and shut our lips, for we can do neither the one nor the other aright if left to ourselves. In times of persecution by ungodly men we are peculiarly liable to speak hastily, or evasively, and therefore we should be specially anxious to be preserved in that direction from every form of sin. How condescending is the Lord! We are ennobled by being door-keepers for him, and yet he deigns to be a door-keeper for us.</p>

polluted. Alas, there is great power in company: even good men arc apt to be swayed by association; hence the fear that we may practise wicked works when we are with wicked workers. We must endeavour not to be with them lest we sin with them. It is bad when the heart goes the wrong way alone, worse when the life runs in the evil road alone; but it is apt to increase unto a high degree of ungodliness when the backslider runs the downward path with a whole horde of sinners around him. Our practice will be our perdition if it be evil: it is an aggravation of sin rather than an excuse for it to say that it is our custom and our habit. It is God&#39;s practice to punish all who make a practice of iniquity. Good men are horrified at the thought of sinning as others do; the fear of it drives them to their knees. Iniquity, which, being interpreted, is a want of equity, is a thing to be shunned as we would avoid an infectious disease. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eat </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dainties.&quot; </span>If we work with them we shall soon eat with them.

If we would not sin with men we had better not sit with them, and if we would not share their wickedness we must not share their wantonness.</span></p>

Sometimes godly men rap hard ; they do not merely hint at evil, but hammer at it; and even then we are to receive the blows in love, and be thankful to the hand which smites so heavily. Pools resent reproof; wise men endeavour to profit by it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reprove </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>excellent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>oil, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sliall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>break </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>head.&quot; </span>Oil breaks no heads, and rebuke does no man any harm; rather, as oil refreshes and perfumes, so does reproof when fitly taken sweeten and renew the heart. My friend must love me well if he will tell me of my faults: there is an unction about him if he is honest enough to point out my errors. Many a man has had his head broken at the feasts of the wicked, but none at the table of a true-hearted reprover. The oil of flattery is not excellent; the oil so lavishly used at the banquet of the reveller is not excellent; head-breaking and heart-breaking attend the anointings of the riotous; but it is otherwise with the severest censures of the godly: they are not always sweet, but they are always excellent; they may for the moment bruise the heart, but they never break either it or the head. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>prayer </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>calamities.&quot; </span>Gracious men never grow wrathful with candid friends so as to harbour an ill-feeling against them ; if so, when they saw them in affliction, they would turn round upon them and taunt them with their rebukes. Far from it; these wisely grateful souls are greatly concerned to see their instructors in trouble, and they bring forth their best prayers for their assistance. They do not merely pray for them, but they so closely and heartily sympathize that their prayers are &quot;in their calamities,&quot; down in the dungeon with them. So true is Christian brotherhood that we are with our friends in sickness or persecution, suffering their griefs; so that our heart&#39;s prayer is in their sorrows. When we can give good men nothing more, let us give them our prayers, and let us do this doubly to those who have given us their rebukes.</p>

Does it refer to the righteous among the Israelites? We think so. David surely means that when their leaders fell never to rise again, they would then turn to him and take delight in listening to his voice. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>When, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>judges </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>overthrown </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stony </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>places, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>words</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sweet.&quot; </span>And so they did: the death of Saul made all the best of the nation look to the son of Jesse as the Lord&#39;s anointed; his words became sweet to them. Many of those good men who had spoken severely of David&#39;s quitting his country, and going over to the Philistines, were nevertheless dear to his heart for their fidelity, and to them he<a id='GBS.PA278.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.297.1.0.box.210.248.1299.346.q.60'>
returned nothing but good-will, loving prayers, and sweet speeches, knowing that by-and-by they would overlook his faults, and select him to be their leader. They smote him when he erred, but they recognized his excellences. He, on his part, bore no resentment, but loved them for their honesty. He would pray for them when their land lay bleeding at the feet of their foreign enemies; he would come to their rescue when their former leaders were slain ; and his words of courageous hopefulness would be sweet in their ears. This seems to me to be a good sense, consistent with the context. At the same time, other and more laboured interpretations have their learned admirers, and to these we will refer in our notes from other authors.</span></p>

David&#39;s case seemed hopeless: the cause of God in Israel was as a dead thing, even as a skeleton broken, and rotten, and shovelled out of the grave, to return as dust to its dust. &quot;Our <span style='font-style:italic;'>bones </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>scattered </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grave&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mouth.&#39;&#39; </span>There seemed to be no life, no cohesion, no form, order, or headship among the godly party in Israel: Saul had demolished it, and scattered all its parts, so that it did not exist as an organized whole. David himself was like one of these dried bones, and the rest of the godly were in much the same condition. There seemed to be no vitality or union among the holy seed; but their cause lay at death&#39;s door. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;As </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>one </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cutteth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cleaveth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wood </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>They were like wood divided and thrown apart: not as one piece of timber, nor even as a bundle, but all cut to pieces, and thoroughly divided. Leaving out the word &quot;wood,&quot; which is supplied by the translators, the figure relates to cleaving upon the earth, which probably means ploughing, but may signify any other form of chopping and splitting, such as felling a forest, tearing up bushes, or otherwise causing confusion and division. How often have good men thought thus of the cause of God! Wherever they have looked, death, division, and destruction have stared them in the face. Cut and cloven, hopelessly sundered! Scattered, yea, scattered at the grave&#39;s mouth! Split up and split for the fire! Such the cause of God and truth has seemed to be. &quot;Upon the earth&#39;&#39; the prospect was wretched; the field of the church was ploughed, harrowed, and scarified: it had become like a wood-chopper&#39;s yard, where everything was doomed to be broken up. We have seen churches in such a state, and have been heart-broken. What a mercy that there is always a place above the earth to which we can look! There lives One who will give a resurrection to his cause, and a reunion to his divided people. He will bring up the dead bones from the grave&#39;s mouth, and make the dried faggots live again. Let us imitate the Psalmist in the next verse, and look up to the living God.</p>

He did not shut his eyes in indifference or despair, neither did he turn them to the creature in vain confidence, but he gave his eyes to his God, and saw nothing to fear. Jehovah his Lord is also his hope. Thomas called Jesus Lord and God, and David here speaks of his God and Lord.

To be destitute in circumstances is bad, but to be destitute in soul is far worse; to be left of friends is a calamity, but to be left of God would be destruction. Destitute of God is destitution with a vengeance. The comfort is that God hath said, &quot;I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.&quot;</span></p>

This was in itself a piece of in-equity, and so of a piece with the rest of their conduct. They were bad themselves, and they wished either to make him like themselves, or to cause him to seem so. If they could not catch the good man in one way, they would try another; snares and gins should be multiplied, for anyhow they were determined to work his ruin. Nobody could preserve David but the Omniscient and Omnipotent One: he also will preserve us. It is hard to keep out of snares which you cannot see, and to escape gins which you cannot discover. Well might the much-hunted Psalmist cry, &quot;Keep me.&quot;</p>

Do we not all wish the innocent to be delivered, and the guilty to reap the result of their own malice? Of course we do, if we are just men.

this world so many aspire unto, and whereof alone they are capable. The whole of it is but a society in perishing sensual enjoyments, without control, and with mutual applauses from one another. This the Psalmist had a special regard unto when casting his eye towards another communion and society which he longed after (verse 5). He saw there not dainties but rebukes: he discerned that which is most opposite unto those mutual applauses and rejoicings in one another, which is the salt and cement of all evil societies, for he noticed rebukes and reproofs for the least miscarriages that shall be observed. Now whereas the dainties which some enjoy in a course of prosperous wickedness, are that alone which seems to have anything iu it amongst them that is desirable, and on the other side rebukes and reproofs are those alone which seem to have any sharpness, or matter of uneasiness and dislike in the society of the godly, David balanceth that which seemeth to be sharpest in the one society, against that which seems to be sweetest in the other, and, without respect unto other advantages, prefers the one above the other. Hence, some read the beginning of the words, &quot;Let the righteous <span style='font-style:italic;'>rather </span>smite me,&quot; meaning, &quot;rather than that I should eat of the dainties of the ungodly.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Owen. </span></span></p>

The sense of smell occupied, perhaps, the most prominent place; for the acceptance of the worship was always indicated by a symbol borrowed from this sense: &quot;The Lord smelled a sweet savour.&quot; The prayer of the people ascended as incense, and the lifting up of their hands as the evening sacrifice. The offering of incense formed an essential part of the religious service. The altar of incense occupied one of the most conspicuous and honoured positions in the tabernacle and temple. . . . On this altar a censer full of incense poured forth its fragrant clouds every morning and evening; and yearly, as the day of atonement came round, when the high priest entered the holy of holies, he filled a censer with live coals from the sacred fire on the altar of burnt offerings, and bore it into the sanctuary, where he threw upon the burning coals the &quot; sweet incense beaten small,&quot; which he had brought in his hand. Without this smoking censer he was forbidden, on pain of death, to enter into the awful shrine of Jehovah. Notwithstanding the washing of his flesh, and the linen garments with which he was clothed, he dare not enter the holiest of all with the blood of atonement, unless he could personally shelter himself under a cloud of incense.</p>

Other writers have attached a mystical import to it, and believed that it was a symbol of the breath of the world arising in praise to the Creator, the four ingredients of which it was composed representing the four elements. While a third class, looking upon the tabernacle as the pnlace of God, the theocratic King of Israel, and the ark of the covenant as his throne, regarded the incense as merely corresponding to the perfume so lavishly employed about the person and appointments of an Oriental monarch. It may doubtless have been intended primarily to serve these purposes and convey these meanings, but it derived its chief importance in connection with the ceremonial observances of the Mosaic ritual from the fact of its being the great symbol of prayer. It was offered at the time when the people were in the posture and act of devotion; and their prayers were supposed to be presented to God by the priest, and to ascend to him in the smoke and odour of that fragrant offering. Scripture is full of allusions to it, understood in this beautiful symbolical sense. Acceptable, prevailing prayer was a sweet-smelling savour to the Lord; and prayer that was unlawful, or hypocritical, or unprofitable, was rejected with disgust by the organ of smell.</p>

The association of sound was lost in that of smell, and the two senses were blended in one. And this symbolical mode of supplication, as Dr. George Wilson has remarked, has this one advantage over spoken or written prayer, that it appealed to those who were both .blind and deaf, a class that are usually shut out from social worship by their affliction.

The blood of the sin-offering was sprinkled on the horns of both on the great day of annual atonement. Morning and evening, as soon as the sacrifice was offered, the censer poured forth its fragrant contents, so that the perpetual incense within ascended simultaneously with the perpetual burnt-offering outside. Without the live coals from off the sacrificial altar, the sacred incense could not be kindled; and without the incense previously filling the holy place, the blood of atonement from the altar of burnt-offering could not be sprinkled on the mercyseat. Beautiful and expressive type of the perfect sacrifice and the all-prevailing intercession of Jesus&#8212;of intercession founded upon atonement, of atonement preceded and followed by intercession! Beautiful and expressive type, too, of the prayers of believers kindled by the altar-fire of Christ&#39;s sacrifice, and perfumed by his merits !&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Hugh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Macmillan, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ministry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Nature,&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>1871.</p>

What an ardour of holy love and friendship, or of anger and malice, may a few words fan into a flame! The tongue is the principal instrument in the cause of God; and it is the chief engine of the devil; give him this, and he asks no more&#8212;there is no mischief or misery he will not accomplish by it. The use, the influence of it, therefore, is inexpressible; and words are never to be considered only as <span style='font-style:italic;'>effects, </span>but as <span style='font-style:italic;'>causes, </span>the operation of which can never be fully imagined.

It will be acknowledged that some have it in their power, by reason of their office, talents, and influence, to do much more injury than others; but none are so insignificant as to be harmless.</p>

There is nothing in which mankind are more universally culpable than in the disorders of speech. Yet with these we are constantly surrounded; and to these we have been accustomed from our impressible infancy. We are in danger from the frequency of speech. &quot;In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.&quot; We must of necessity speak often; but we often speak without necessity. Duty calls us to intsrmingle much with our fellowcreatures; but we are too little in the closet, and too much in the crowd&#8212;and when we are in company we forget the admonition, &quot;Let every man be swift to hear, and slow to speak.&quot;</p>

He that would live in communion with God for the present, and hope to appear with comfort before him hereafter, is sensible of the least thing that tends to God&#39;s displeasure, and God&#39;s dishonour: this is the true spirit of one that will be owned by Christ at the last day.

Nathan was the chirurgeon whom God imployed to search that wound which had divers mouths for festering in his soul; and truly he did not dally with his patient, though he were a prince, but thrust his instrument to the bottom; yet whatever pain it put him to, he took it patiently, and was so far from being angry with the prophet, that he made him one of his privy council.

They are in a church what a very witty and sarcastic person is in society, or what a tell-tale is in a school ; and approximate very closely to that class which the apostle terms &quot;busybodies in other men&#39;s matters.&quot; Our manner must be tender and winning. The nail of reproof, says an old writer, must be well oiled in kindness before it is driven home. Meddling with the faults of others is like attempting to move a person afflicted with the rheumatic gout : it must be done slowly and tenderly, nor must we be frightened by an outcry or two. The great thing is to show the person that you really love him; and if you manifest this in the sight of God, he will bless your efforts, and give you favour in the sight of an erring brother.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Christian </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Treasury. </span></p>
