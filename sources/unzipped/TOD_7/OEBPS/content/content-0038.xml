Thanks are the least that we can offer, and these we ought freely to give. The inspired writer calls us to praise Jehovah for all his goodness to us, and all the greatness of his power in blessing his chosen. We thank our parents, let us praise our heavenly Father; we are grateful to our benefactors, let us give thanks unto the Giver of all good. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>Essentially he is goodness itself, practically all that he does is good, relatively he is good to his creatures. Let us thank him that we have seen, proved, and tasted that he is good. He is good beyond all others: indeed, he alone is good in the highest sense; he is the source of good, the good of all good, the sustaincr of good, the perfecter of good, and the rewarder of good. For this he deserves the constant gratitude of his people. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>We shall have this repeated in every verse of this song, but not once too often. It is the sweetest stanza that a man can sing. What joy that there is mercy, mercy with Jehovah, enduring mercy, mercy enduring for ever. We are ever needing it, trying it, praying for it, receiving it: therefore let us for ever sing of it.</p>

Jehovah is our God, to be worshipped and adored, and he is worthy of our reverence to the highest degree.

All lordship is vested in the Eternal. He makes and administers law, he rules and governs mind and matter, he possesses in himself all sovereignty and power. All lords in the plural are summed up in this Lord in the singular; he is more lordly than all emperors and kings condensed into one. For this we may well be thankful, for we know the superior Sovereign will rectify the abuses of the underlings who now lord it over mankind. He will call these lords to his bar, and reckon with them for every oppression and injustice. He is as truly the Lord of lords as he is Lord over the meanest of the land, and he rules with a strict impartiality, for which every just man should give heartiest thanks. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;&#39;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>Yes, he mingles mercy with his justice, and reigns for the benefit of his subjects. He pities the sorrowful, protects the helpless, provides for the needy, and pardons the guilty; and this he does from generation to generation, never wearying of his grace, &quot;because he delighteth in mercy.&quot; Let us arouse ourselves to laud our glorious Lord! A third time let us thank him who is our Jehovah, our God, and our Lord ; and let this one reason suffice us for three thanksgivings, or for three thousand&#8212;</p>

None can be likened unto him, he is alone in wonder-land, the Creator and Worker of true marvels, compared with which all other remarkable things are as child&#39;s play. His works are all great in wonder even when they are not great in size; in fact, in the minute objects of the microscope we behold as great wonders as even the telescope can reveal. All the works of his unrivalled skill are wrought by him alone and unaided, and to him, therefore, must be undivided honour. None of the gods or the lords helped Jehovah in creation, or in the redemption of his people: his own right hand and his holy arm have wrought for him these great deeds. What have the gods of the heathen done? If the question be settled by doings, Jehovah is indeed &quot;alone.&quot; It is exceedingly wonderful that men should worship gods who can do nothing, and forget the Lord who alone doetb great wonders.

The discoveries of our keenest observers have never searched out all the evidences of design which are crowded together in this work of God&#39;s hands. The lives of plants, animals, and men are dependent upon the fashioning of our heavens: had the skies been other than they are we had not been here to praise God.

Whenever we sit in the sunshine, our gratitude should be kindled. The sun is a great ruler, and his government is pure beneficence, because by God&#39;s mercy it is moderated to our feebleness; let all who rule take lessons from the sun which rules to bless. By day we may well give thanks, for God gives cheer.

The former blows had missed their aim compared with the last; but that &quot; smote Egypt.&quot; The Lord&#39;s firstborn had been oppressed by Egypt, and at last the Lord fulfilled his threatening, &quot;I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.&quot; Justice lingered but it struck home at last. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>Yes, even to the extremity of vengeance upon a whole nation the Lord&#39;s mercy to his people endured.

Let us even when the Lord&#39;s judgments are abroad in the earth continue to sing of his unfailing grace.</span></p>

By faith we also give up all reliance upon works and trust ourselves to pass by a way which we have not known, even by the way of reliance upon the atoning blood : thus are we effectually sundered from the Egypt of our former estate, and our sins themselves are drowned. The people marched dry shod through the heart of the sea. Hallelujah! &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>merry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endurcth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vccr.&quot; </span>Mercy cleared the road, irercy cheered the host, mercy led them down, and mercy brought them up again.

Though we hear them sounding peal upon peal, yet the judgments of the Lord were only loud-mouthed mercies speaking confusion to the foe, that the chosen might tremble before him no longer. The chariots were thrown over, the horses were overthrown. The King and his warriors were alike overwhelmed; they were hurled from their chariots as locusts are tossed to and fro in the wind. Uroken was the power and conquered was the pride of Egypt. Jehovah had vanquished the enemy. &quot;Art thou not it which cut Rahab and wounded the crocodile?&quot; None are too great for the Lord to subdue, none too high for the Lord to abase. The enemy in his fury drove after Israel into the sea, but there his wrath found a terrible recompense beneath the waves. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endurethfor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>crcr.&quot; </span>Yes, metcy continued to protect its children, and therefore called in the aid of justice to fulfil the capital sentence on their foes. Taken redhanded, in the very act of rebellion against their sovereign Lord, the audacious adversaries met the fate which they had themselves invited. He that goes down into the midst of the sea asks to be drowned. Sin is self-damnation. The sinner goes downward of his own choice, and if he finds out too late that he cannot return, is not his blood upon his own head? The finally impenitent, however terrible their doom, will not be witnesses against mercy; but rather this shall aggravate their mijery, that they went on in defiance of mercy, and would not yield themselves to him whose mercy endureth forever. To the Israelites as they sung this song their one thought would be of the rescue of their fathers from the fierce oppressor. Taken like a lamb from between the teeth of the lion, Israel justly praises her Deliverer and chants aloud:</p>

First, his <span style='font-style:italic;'>essential </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span>is everlastingness itself; for it is himself, and God hath not, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>is, </span>things.

In considering the expression of solar force, in its widest generality, we find that it gives rise to alterations on the surface of the earth,&#8212;partly by grevitative attraction.&#8212;as in the ebb and flow of the ocean (if we except the share taken in the phenomenon by lunar attraction), partly by light and heat-generating transverse vibrations of ether, as in the fructifying admixture of the ai-riul and aqueous envelopes of our planet, from the contact of the atmosphere with the vaporizing fluid element in seas, lakes, and rivers. The solar action operates, moreover, by differences of heat, in exciting atmospheric and oceanic currents; the latter of which have continued for thousands of years (though in an inconsiderable degree) to accumulate or waste away alluvial strata, and thus change the surface of the inundated land; it operates in the generation and maintenance of the electro-magnetic activity of the earth&#39;s crust, and that of the oxygen contained in the atmosphere; at one time calling forth calm and gentle forces of chemical attraction, and variously determining organic life in the endosmose of cell-walls and in tissue of muscular and nervous fibres; at another time evoking light processes in the atmosphere, such as the coloured coruscations of the polar light, thunder and lightning, hurricanes and waterspouts.</p>

moon round the heavens marks out our months; and by regularly changing its figure at the four quarters of its course, subdivides the months into two periods of weeks, and thus exhibits to all the nations of the earth a &quot;watch-light,&quot; or signal, which every seven days presents a form entirely uew, for marking out the shorter periods of duration. By its nearness to the earth, and the consequent increase of its gravitating power, it produces currents in the atmosphere, which direct the course of the winds, and purify the aerial fluid from noxious exhalations; it raises the waters of the ocean, and perpetuates the regular returns of ebb and flow, by which the liquid element is preserved from filth and putrefaction. It extends its sway even over the human frame, and our health and disorders are sometimes partially dependent on its influence. Even its eclipses, and those it produces of the sun, are not without their use. They tend to arouse mankind to the study of astronomy, and the wonders of the firmament; they serve to confirm the deductions of chronology, to direct the navigator, and to settle the geographical position of towns and countries; they assist the astronomer in his celestial investigations, and exhibit an agreeable variety of phenomena in the scenery of the heavens. In short, there are terrestrial scenes presented in moon-light, which, in point of solemnity, grandeur, and picturesque beauty, far surpass in interest, to a poetic imagination, all the brilliancy and splendours of noon-day. Hence, in all ages, a moonlight scene has been regarded, by all ranks of men, with feelings of joy and sentiments of admiration. The following description of Homer, translated into English verse by Pope, has been esteemed one of the finest night-pieces in poetry :&#8212;</span></p>
