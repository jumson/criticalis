Why? what was Zion? We know it was but a hill in Jerusalem, on the north side. Why is that hill so honoured? No reason in the world but this,&#8212;that upon it the Temple was built; and so, that Zion is much spoken of, and much made of, it is only for the Temple&#39;s sake. For whose sake it is (even for his church), that &quot; the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob&quot; (Ps. Ixxxvii. 2); loveth her more, and so her captivity goeth nearer him, and her deliverance better pleaseth him, than all Jacob besides. This maketh <span style='font-style:italic;'>Zion&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>captivity </span>to be mentioned chiefly, as chiefly regarded by God, and to be regarded by his people. As we see it was: when they sat by the waters of Babylon, that which made them weep was, &quot;When we remembered thee, O Zion&quot; ; that was their greatest grief.

Peter, being imprisoned by Herod, when he was delivered by an angel, for all the light that did shine in the prison ; though the angel did smite him on the side and raised him up; though he caused the chains to fall off his hands; though he spake to him three several times, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Surge, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cinge, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>circunda</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;</span>Arise quickly, gird thyself, and cast thy garment about thee&quot; ; though he conducted him safely by the watches; and though he caused the iron gates to open willingly; yet for all this he was like unto them that dream. &quot;For he wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision&quot;: Acts xii. 9. When old Jacob was told by his sons that his son Joseph was alive, his heart failed, and he believed them not; but when he had heard all that Joseph had said, and when he saw the chariots that Joseph had sent, then, as it were, raised from a sleep, and awakened from a dream, his spirit revived, and, rejoicing, he cried out, &quot;I have enough ; Joseph my son is yet alive.&quot;</p>

Livy says that when the herald had finished there was more good news than the people could receive all at once. They could scarcely believe that they had heard aright.

Thus Cajetan, Shindler, and others would have it translated here; and it suits best with the following words, &quot;Then were our mouths filled with laughter, and our tongues with praise.&quot; When a man is in a good dream, his mouth is not filled with laughter, nor his tongue with praise : if a man be in a bad dream, his mouth is not tilled with laughter, nor his tongue with praise; but when a man is restored to health after a great sickness, it is so.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bridge, </span>1600&#8212;1670.</p>

This joy properly pertaineth to captives, that is, to those that feel the captivity of sin and death ; to the fleshy and tender hearts, terrified with the feeling of the wrath and judgment of God. These are the disciples in whose hearts should be planted laughter and joy, and that by the authority of the Holy Ghost, which this verse setteth forth. This people was in Zion, and, after the outward show of the kingdom and priesthood, did mightily flourish; but if a man consider them according to the spirit, he shall see them to be in miserable captivity, and that their tongue is full of heaviness and mourning, because their heart is terrified with the sense of sin and death. This is Moses&#39; tongue or Moses&#39; mouth, full of wormwood and of the bitterness of death; wherewith he designs to kill none but those which are too lively and full of security. But they who feel their captivity shall have their mouths filled with laughter and joy: that is, redemption and deliverance from sin and death shall be preached unto them. This is the sense and meaning of the Holy Ghost, that the mouth of such shall be filled with laughter, that is, their mouth shall show forth nothing else but great gladness through the inestimable consolations of the gospel, with voices of triumph and victory by Christ, overcoming Satan, destroying death, and taking away sins. This was first spoken unto the Jews; for this laughter was first offered to that people, then having the promises. Now he turneth to the Gentiles, whom he calleth to the partaking of this laughter.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Martin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luther. </span></p>

It was thus at Baal-Perazim. It was thus when one morning, after many nights of gloom, Jerusalem arose at dawn of day, and found Sennacherib&#39;s thousands a camp of the dead. And it has all along been the manner of our God.</p>

The reason is this, because the south is a dry country, where there are few springs, scarce a fountain to be found in a whole desert. What, then, are the waters they have in the south, in those parched countries? They are these mighty strong torrents, which are caused by the showers of heaven: so the meaning of that prayer in the psalm is, that God would suddenly turn their captivity. Rivers come suddenly in the south : where no spring appears, nor any sign of a river, yet in an hour the water is up and the streams overflow. As when Elijah sent his servant toward the sea, in the time of Ahab, he went and looked, and said, &quot;there is nothing&quot; ; that is, no show of rain, not the least cloud to be seen; yet presently the heavens grew black, and there was a great rain: 1 Kings xviii. 44. Thus let our captivity be turned thus speedily and suddenly, though there be no appearance of salvation, no more than there is of a fountain in the sandy desert, or of rain in the clearest of heavens, yet bring salvation for us. We use to say of things beyond our supply, Have we a spring of them? or can we fetch them out of the clouds? So though no ground appears whence such rivers should flow, yet let our salvation be as rivers in the south, as rivers fetched out of the clouds, and dropped in an instant immediately from the heavens.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl, </span>1602&#8212;1673.</p>

The time which God chose and the instrument he used to give the captive Jews their gaol delivery and liberty to return home were so incredible to them when it came to pass (like Peter whom the angel had carried out of prison, Acts xii.), it was some time before they could come to themselves and resolve whether it was a real truth, or but a pleasing dream. Now see, what effect this strange disappointment of their fears had upon their hope for afterward. It sends them to the throne of grace for the accomplishment of what was so marvellously begun. &quot;The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. Turn again our captivity, O Lord &quot; : verses 3, 4. They have got a hand-hold by this experiment of his power and mercy, and they will not now let him go till they have more; yea, their hope is raised to such a pitch of confidence, that they draw a general conclusion from this particular experience for the comfort of themselves or others in any future distress: &quot;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,&quot; etc., verses 5, 6.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall, </span>1617&#8212;1679.</p>

In seasons of great scarcity, the poor peasants part in sorrow with every measure of precious seed cast into the ground. It is like taking bread out of the mouths of their children; and in such times many bitter tears are actually shed over it. The distress is frequently so great that government is obliged to furnish seed, or none would be sown. Ibrahim Pasha did this more than once within my remembrance, copying the example, perhaps, of his great predecessor in Egypt when the seven years&#39; famine was ended.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA21.w.1.4.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.40.1.4.box.231.2012.1297.319.q.60'>The thoughts of this psalm may likewise have been suggested by the extreme danger which frequently attends the fanner in his ploughing and sowing. The calamity which fell upon the husbandmen of Job when the oxen were ploughing, aud the asses feeding beside them, and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword (Job i. 14, 15), is often repeated in our day. To understand this you must remember what I have just told you about the situation of the arable lands in the open country; and here again we meet that verbal accuracy: the sower &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>goes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forth&quot;</span>&#8212;that is, from the village. The people of Ibel and Khiem, in Merj&#39; Aijtin, for example, have<a id='GBS.PA22.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.41.1.0.box.214.258.1299.559.q.60'>
their best grain-growing fields down in the &#39;Ard Hfileh, six or eight miles from their homes, and just that much nearer the lawless border of the desert. When the country is disturbed, or the government weak, they cannot sow these lands except at the risk of their lives. Indeed, they always <span style='font-style:italic;'>go </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forth </span>in large companies, and completely armed, ready to drop the plough and seize the musket at a moment&#39;s warning; and yet, with all this care, many sad and fatal calamities overtake the men who must thus sow in tears. And still another origin may be found for the thoughts of the psalm in the extreme difficulty of the work itself in many places. The soil is rocky, impracticable, overgrown with sharp thorns; and it costs much painful toil to break up and gather out the rock, cut and burn the briars, and to subdue the stubborn soil, especially with their feeble oxen and insignificant ploughs. Join all these together, and the sentiment is very forcibly brought out, that he who labors hard, in cold and rain, in fear and danger, in poverty and in want, casting his precious seed into the ground, will surely come again, at harvest-time, with rejoicing, and bearing his sheaves with him.&#8212; II&#39;. ..I/. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomson. </span></span></p>

In the sweat of his brow the husbandman tills his land, and casts the seed into the ground, where for a time it lies dead and buried. A dark and dreary winter succeeds, and all seems to be lost; but at the return of spring universal nature revives, and the once desolate fields are covered with corn which, when matured by the sun&#39;s heat, the cheerful reapers cut down, and it is brought home with triumphant shouts of joy. Here, O disciple of Jesus, behold an emblem of thy present labour and thy future reward! Thou &quot;sowest,&quot; perhaps, in &quot;tears&quot;; thou doest thy duty amidst persecution, and affliction, sickness, pain, and sorrow; thou labourest in th&#171; Church, and no account is made of thy labours, no profit seems likely to arise from them. Nay, thou must thyself drop into the dust of death, and all the storms of that winter must pass over thee, until thy form shall be perished, and thou shalt see corruption. Yet the day is coming when thou shalt &quot; reap in joy,&quot; and plentiful shall be thy harvest.

I. That the afflictions of God&#39;s people are as sowing in tears. 1. In sowing ye know there is great pains. The land must be first tilled and dressed; and there is pains in casting the seed into it; and then it takes a great dressing all the year, before it be set in the barn-yard. 2. It requires great charges, too, and therefore it is called &quot; precious seed.&quot; For ye know that seed corn is aye dearest. 3. There is also great hazard; for corn, after it is sown, is subject to many dangers. And so it is with the children of God in a good cause. II. Then after the seed-time follows the harvest, and that comes with joy. There be three degrees of the happiness of God&#39;s children, in reaping of fruits. 1. In the first-fruits. Even when they are enduring anything for the Gospel of Christ, it carries contentment and fruit with it. 2. After the first-fruits, then come sheaves to refresh the husbandman, and to assure him that the full harvest is coming. The Lord now and then gives testimony of a full deliverance to his own people, especially of the deliverance of Sion, and lets them taste of the sheaves which they have reaped. 3. And lastly, they get the full harvest; and that is gotten at the great and last day. Then we get peace without trouble, joy without grief, profit without loss, pleasure without pain; and then we have a full sight of the face of God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#8212;Alexander </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Henderson. </span></p>

If thou wouldst be cheerful, saith Chrysostom, be sad. It was the end of Christ&#39;s anointing and coming into the world, that he might comfort them that mourn : Isaiah Ixi. 3. Christ had the oil of gladness poured on him, as Chrysostom saith, that he might pour it on the mourner; well then might the apostle call it &quot; a repentance not to be repented of &quot; : 2 Cor. vii. 10. ... Here is sweet fruit from a bitter stock: Christ caused the earthen vessels to be filled with water, and then turned the water into wine: John ii. 9. So when the eye, that earthen vessel, hath been filled with water brim full, then Christ will turn the water of tears into the wine of joy. Holy mourning, saith St. Basil, is the seed out of which the flower of eternal joy doth grow.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Watson </span>(&#8212;1690 ?), <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Beatitudes.&#39;&#39; </span></p>

none but they shall. They shall ; and good reason they should, because it was they that did sow. And though some that have sown in tears do complain of the lateness or thinness of the harvest, that they have not reaped in joy, as is here promised ; know that some grounds are later than others, and in some years the harvest falleth later than in others, and that God, who is the Lord of the harvest, in his good time will ripen thy joy, and thou shalt reap it: and in the meantime, if we try it narrowly, we shall find the cause in ourselves, both of the lateness of our joy, because we were too late in sowing our tears; and of the thinness of our joy, because we did sow our tears too thin. And if after our sowing of tears we find no harvest of joy at all, we may be well assured that either our seed was not good, or else some of the mischances are come upon them, which came upon the seed that came to no good in the thirteenth of Matthew. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Walter </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Balcanqual, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>St. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Maries </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Spittle,&quot; </span>1623.</span></p>

And therefore you who think so basely of the gospel and the professors of it, because at present their peace and comfort are not come, should know that it is on the way to them, and comes to stay everlastingly with them ; whereas your peace is going from you every moment, and is sure to leave you without any hope of returning to you again. Look not how the Christian begins, but ends. The Spirit of God by his tonvictions comes into the soul with some terrors, but it closeth with peace and joy.
