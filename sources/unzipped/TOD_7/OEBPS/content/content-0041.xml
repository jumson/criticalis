Three times a-year they came up from the country in companies, singing these sweet songs of Zion&#8212;lifting their eyes to the hills whence came their help. But now, when they were in captivity, they hanged their harps upon the willows; and when their cruel spoilers demanded mirth and a song, they said: &quot;How shall we sing the.Lord&#39;s song in a strange land?&quot; So is it with the believer in darkness. He hangs his harp upon the willows, and cannot sing the song of the Lord. Every believer has got u harp. Every heart that has been made new is turned into a harp of praise. The mouth is filled with laughter&#8212;the tongue with divinest melody. Every true Christian loves praise&#8212;the holiest Christians love it most. But when the believer falls into sin and darkness, his harp is on the willows, and he cannot sing the Lord&#39;s song, for he is in a strange land.</p>

He will look over all the pleasures of the world and the pleasures of sin, and say, &quot; A day in thy courts is better than a thousand &quot;&#8212;&quot; If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Condensed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Murray </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>WCheyne, </span>1813&#8212;1843.</p>

Indeed, nothing can be more exquisitely beautiful. It is written in a strain of sensibility that must touch every soul that is capable of feeling. It is remarkable that Dr. Watts, in his excellent versification, has omitted it. He has indeed some verses upon it in his Lyrics; and many others have written on this ode. We have seen more than ten productions of this kind; the last, and perhaps the best, of which is Lord Byron&#39;s. But who is satisfied with any of these attempts? Thus it begins: &quot;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.&quot; These rivers were probably some of the streams branching off from the Euphrates and Tigris. Here it is commonly supposed these captive Jews were placed by their task-masters, to preserve or repair the water-works. But is it improper .to conjecture that the Psalmist refers to their being here; not constantly, but occasionally; not by compulsion, but choice? Hither I imagine their retiring, to unbend their oppressed minds in solitude. &quot;Come,&quot; said one of these pious Jews to another, &quot;come, let us for a while go forth, from this vanity and vileness. Let us assemble together by ourselves under the refreshing shade of the willows by the watercourses. And let us take our harps with us, and solace ourselves with some of the songs of Zion.&quot; But as soon as they arrive, and begin to touch the chords, the notes&#8212;such is the power of association &#8212;awaken the memory of their former privileges and pleasures. And, overwhelmed with grief, they sit down on the grass; and weep when they remember Ziou; their dejected looks, averted from each other, seeming to say, &quot; If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let iny tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.&quot; But what do they with their harps? The voice of mirth is heard no more, and all the daughters of music are brought low. Melody is not in<a id='GBS.PA194.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.213.1.0.box.246.243.1305.249.q.60'>
season to a distressed spirit. &quot;Is any afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merry Let him sing psalms.&quot; &quot;As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.&quot; They did not, however, break them to pieces, or throw them into the stream&#8212;but <span style='font-style:italic;'>hanged </span>them up only. They hoped that what they could not use at present they might be able to resume at some happier period. To be cast down is not to be destroyed. Distress is not despondency.</span></p>

known poet, Alexander Pope, who resided at Twickenham, received a basket of figs as a present from Turkey.

It had some tiny buds upon it, and he hoped he might be able to rear it, as none of this species of willow was known in England. Happily the willow is very quick to take root and grow. The little branch soon became a tree, and drooped gracefully over the river, in the same manner that its race had done over the waters of Babylon. From that one branch all the Weeping Willows in England are descended.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Mary </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Elizabeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kirby, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Chapters </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Trees,&quot; </span>1873.</span></p>

But the eighth verse emphatically declares that the retributive justice of God will visit upon apocalyptic Babylon the same infliction which Assyrian Babylon, and ulso Pagan Rome, inflicted upon Jerusalem. As therefore Nebuchadnezzar as well as Titus &quot; burnt the house of the Lord, and the king&#39;s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man&#39;s house burnt he with tire&quot; (2 Kings xxv. 9), so &quot; the ten horns shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall catcher flesh, and burn her with fire; and she shall be utterly burned with fire&quot; (Rev. xvii. 16; xviii. 8). When the Canaanites had filled up the measure of their iniquity, Israel received a divine commission to exterminate the guilty nation. When Papal Rome shall have filled up the measure of her iniquity, then &quot; a mighty angel will take up a atone, like a great millstone, and will cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down&quot;: &quot;For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double&quot; (Rev. xviii. 5, 6). Then shall issue the divine proclamation: &quot;Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her&quot; (Rev. xviii. 20).&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Noble </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cole</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Book </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psalms, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Notes,&quot; </span>1863.</span></p>
