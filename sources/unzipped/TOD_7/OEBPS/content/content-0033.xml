The combination of the two adjectives &quot; good &quot; and &quot;pleasant,&quot; is more remarkable than the conjunction of two stars of the first magnitude: for a thing to be &quot;good&quot; is good, but for it also to be pleasant is better. All men love pleasant things, and yet it frequently happens that the pleasure is evil; but here the condition is as good as it is pleasant, as pleasant as it is good, for the same &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>how&quot; </span>is set before each qualifying word.</p>

When brethren can and do dwell together <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unity, </span>then is their communion worthy to be gazed upon and sung of in holy psalmody. Such sights ought often to be seen among those who are near of kin, for they are brethren, and therefore should be united in heart and aim; they dwell together, and it is for their mutual comfort that there should be no strife; and yet how many families are rent by fierce feuds, and exhibit a spectacle which is neither good nor pleasant!</p>

We can dispense with uniformity if we possess unity: oneness of life, truth, and way; oneness in Christ Jesus; oneness of object and spirit&#8212;these we must have, or our assemblies will be synagogues of contention rather than churches of Christ. The closer the unity the better; for the more of the good and the pleasant there will be. Since we are imperfect beings, somewhat of the evil and the unpleasant is sure to intrude; but this will readily be neutralized and easily ejected by the true love of the saints, if it really exists. Christian unity is good in itself, good for ourselves, good for the brethren, good for our converts, good for the outside world ; and for certain it is pleasant; for a loving heart must have pleasure and give pleasure in associating with others of like nature. A church united for years in earnest service of the Lord is a well of goodness and joy to all those who dwell round about it.</p>

It has <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>meet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perfume </span>about it, comparable to that precious ointment with which the first High Priest was anointed at his ordination. It is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>Imli/ </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thing, </span>and so again is like the oil of consecration which was to be used only in the Lord&#39;s service. What a sacred thing must brotherly love be when it can be likened to an oil which must never be poured on any man but on the Lord&#39;s high-priest alone! It is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>diffusive </span>thing: being poured on his head the fragrant oil flowed down upon Aaron&#39;s head, and thence dropped upon his garments till the utmost hem was anointed therewith ; and even so doth brotherly love extend its benign power and bless all who are beneath its influence. Hearty concord brings a benediction upon all concerned; its goodness and pleasure are shared in by the lowliest members of the household; even the servants are the better and the happier because of the lovely unity among the members of the family. <span style='font-style:italic;'>It </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>has </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>special </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>use </span>about it; for as by the anointing oil Aaron was &#39;set apart for the special service of Jehovah, even so those who dwell in love are &#39;the better fitted to glorify God in his church. The Lord is not likely to use for his glory those who are devoid of love ; they lack the anointing needful to make them priests unto the Lord. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ran </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heard, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Aaron&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heard.&quot; </span>This is a chief point of comparison, that as the oil did not remain confined to the place where it first fell, but flowed adown the High Priest&#39;s hair and bedewed his beard, even so brotherly love descending from the head distils and descends, &#39;anointing as it runs, and perfuming all it lights upon. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>went </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>skirts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>garments.&quot; </span>Once set in motion it would not cease from flowing. It might seem as if it were better not to smear his garments with oil, but the sacred unguent could not be restrained, it flowed over his holy robes; even thus does brotherly love not only flow over the hearts upon which it was first poured out, and descend to those who are an inferior part of the mystical body of Christ, but it runs where it is not sought for, asking&#39;neither leave nor license to make its way. Christian affection knows no limits of parish, nation, sect, or age. Is the man a believer in Christ? Then he is in the one body, and I must yield him an abiding love. Is he one of the poorest, one of the least spiritual, one of the least lovsible? Then he is as the skirts of the garment, and my heart&#39;s love must fall even upon him. Brotherly love comes from the head, but falls to the feet. Its way is downward. It &quot; ran down,&quot; and it &quot; went down&quot; : love for the brethren condescends to men of low estate, it is not puffed up, but is lowly and meek. This is no small part of its excellence: oil would not anoint if it did not flow down, neither would brotherly love diffuse its blessing if it did not descend.</p>

The Alpine Lebanon ministers to the minor elevation of the city of David ; and so does brotherly love descend from the higher to the lower, refreshing and enlivening in its course. Holy concord is as dew, mysteriously blessed, full of life and growth for all plants of grace. It brings with it so much benediction that it is as no common dew, but<a id='GBS.PA123.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.142.1.0.box.271.264.1301.523.q.60'>

The proper rendering is, &quot;As the dew of Hermon that descended upon the mountains of Zion,&quot; and this tallies with the figure which has been already used ; and sets ferth by a second simile the sweet descending diffusiveness of brotherly unity. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Loud </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>commanded </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blessing, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>life </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evermore.&quot; </span>That is, in Zion, or better still, in the place where brotherly love abounds. Where love reigns God reigns. Where love wishes blessing, there God commands the blessing. God has but to command, and it is done. He is so pleased to see his dear children happy in one another that he fails not to make them happy in himself. He gives especially his best blessing of eternal life, for love is life; dwelling together in love we have begun the enjoyments of eternity, and these shall not be taken from us. Let us love for evermore, and we shall live for evermore. This makes Christian brotherhood so good and pleasant; it has Jehovah&#39;s blessing resting upon it, and it cannot be otherwise than sacred like &quot; the precious ointment,&quot; and heavenly like &quot; the dew of Hennon.&quot;</span></p>

David recognized this truth when he selected the profuse anointing of Aaron with the oil of consecration at his installation into the office of High Priest as a fit emblem of brotherly love. There was waste in that anointing, too, as well as in the one which took place at Bethany. For the oil was not <span style='font-style:italic;'>sprinkled </span>on the head of Aaron, though that might have been sufficient for the purpose of a mere ceremony. The vessel was emptied on the High Priest&#39;s person, so that its contents flowed down from the head upon the beard, and even to the skirts of the sacerdotal robes. In that very waste lay the point of the resemblance for David. It was a feature that was very likely to strike his mind, for he, too, was a wasteful man in his way. He had loved God in a manner which exposed him to the charge of extravagance. He had danced before the Lord, for example, when the ark was brought up from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem, forgetful of his dignity, exceeding the bounds of decorum, and, as it might seem, without excuse, as a much less hearty demonstration would have served the purpose of a religioussolemnity.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Alexander </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Balinain </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bruce, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Training </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Twelve,&quot; </span>1877.</p>

the dew of Hermon descending upon the mountains of Zion,&quot; says Van de Velde in his &quot; Travels&quot; (Bd. i. 8. 97), &quot;is now become quite clear to me. Here as I sat at the foot of Hermon, I understood how the water-drops which rose from its forest-mantled heights, and out of the highest ravines, which are filled the whole year round with snow, after the sun&#39;s rays have attenuated them and moistened the atmosphere with them, descend at evening-time as a heavy dew upon thelower mountains which lie round about as its spurs. One ought to have seen Hermon with its white-golden crown glistening aloft in the blue sky, in order to be able rightly to understand the figure. Nowhere in the whole country is so heavy a dew perceptible as in the districts near to Hermon.&quot; To this dew the poet likens brotherly love. This is &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dew </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hermon&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup></span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>of such pristine freshness and thus refreshing, possessing such pristine power and thus quickening, thus born from above (ex. 3), and in fact like the dew of Hermon which comes down upon the mountains of Zion&#8212;a feature in the picture which is taken from the natural reality; for an abundant dew, when warm days have preceded, might very well be diverted to Jerusalem by the operation of the cold current of air sweeping down from the north over Hermon. We know, indeed, from our own experience how far off a cold air coming from the Alps is perceptible, and produces its effects. The figure of the poet is therefore as true to nature as it is beautiful. When brethren bound together in love also meet together in one place, and, in fact, when brethren of the north unite with brethren in the south in Jerusalem, the city which is the mother of all, at the great Feasts, it is as when the dew of Mount Hermon, which is covered with deep, almost eternal snow, descends upon the bare, unfruitful&#8212;and therefore longing for such quickening&#8212; mountains round about Zion. In Jerusalem must love and all that is good meet. &#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Franz </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Delitesch. </span></span></p>

Unlike most other mountains which gradually rise from lofty table-lands and often at a distance from the sea, Hermon starts at once to the height of nearly ten thousand feet, from a platform scarcely above the sea level. This platform, too&#8212;the upper Jordan valley j and marshes of Merom&#8212;is for the most part an impenetrable swamp of unknown depth, whence the seething vapour, under the rays of an almost tropical sun, is constantly ascending into the upper atmosphere during the day. The vapour, coming in contact with the snowy sides of the mountain, is rapidly congealed, and is precipitated in the evening in the form of a dew, the most copious we ever experienced. It penetrated everywhere, and saturated everything. The floor of our tent was soaked, our bed was covered with it, our guns were dripping, and dewdrops hung about everywhere. No wonder that the foot of Hermon is clad with orchards and gardens of such marvellous fertility in this land of droughts. &#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Baker </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tristram, </span>1867.</p>

They are brethren, 1. Because born of God, who is &quot; the God of peace.&quot; Their claim to the brotherhood is dependent upon likeness to Him: Mat. v. 9. 2. Because united to Christ, who as elder brother desires unity: John xvii. 20, 21. Not to seek it is virtually to disown Him. 8. Because &quot; by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body&quot; (1 Cor. xii. 13), wherein unity must be kept: Eph. iv. 3. 4.

Church union is sacred. It must spring from the love commanded by God ; be based on the principles laid down by God; and exist for the ends appointed of God.

Church unity is of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. xiii. 13), through Jesus as mediator. Therefore it should be prayed for, and thankfully acknowledged. III. <span style='font-style:italic;'>By </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anointing, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Aaron </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>became </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consecrated, </span>and officially qualified to act as priest.

Thus, Christian concord in church-fellowship&#8212;I. Despises not the little ones, <span style='font-style:italic;'>i.e. </span>the mean, poor, and less gifted. It, 1. Recognises that God is the Father, and Christ is the Redeemer of all believers alike. 2. Acknowledges oneness of faith as the true basis of fellowship; not wealth, social position or talent. 3. Believes that the least member is essential to the completeness of Christ&#39;s body. 4. Realises that everything which renders one in any way superior to another is the gift of God. II. Distributes of its abundance to the needy: Acts iv. 32&#8212;37. 1. The wealthy to the poor: 1 John iii. 17. 2. The learned to the ignorant. 3. The joyful to the sorrowing. 4. The steadfast to the erring: Jas. v. 19. III. Displays its value more by loving generosity, than by a conspicuous appearance before the world. As Hermon was more valuable to 2ion for its dew than for its adornment of the landscape. 1. A generous activity exhibits and requires more real grace than showy architecture or ornate worship does. 2. Through it, godliness flourishes more than by a vaunted respectability. Zion was fertilized by the dew, not by the grandeur of Hermon. 3.
