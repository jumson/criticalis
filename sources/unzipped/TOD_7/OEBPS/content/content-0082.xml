The exhortation is to all things in earth or in heaven. Should they not all declare the glory of him for whose glory they are, and were created?

See how power is mentioned with holiness in this change of names. Praise begins at home. &quot;la God&#39;s own house pronounce his praise.&quot; The holy place should be filled with praise, even as of old the high-priest filled the <span style='font-style:italic;'>sanctum </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sanctorum </span>with the smoke of sweet-smelling incense. In his church below and in his courts above hallelujahs should be continually presented. In the person of Jesus God finds a holy dwelling or sanctuary, and there he is greatly to be praised. He may also be said to dwell in holiness, for all his ways are right and good; for this we ought to extol him with heart and with voice. Whenever we assemble for holy purposes our main work should be to present praises unto the Lord our God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>firmament </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>power.&#39;&#39; </span>It is a blessed thing that in our God holiness and power are united. Power without righteousness would be oppression, and righteousness without power would be too weak for usefulness; but put the two together in an infinite degree and we have God. What an expanse we have in the boundless firmament of divine power! Let it all be filled with praise. Let the heavens, so great and strong, echo with the praise of the thrice holy Jehovah, while the sanctuaries of earth magnify the Almighty One.</p>

a multitude or a plenitude of greatness, and therefore he should be greatly praised. There is nothing little about God, and there is nothing great apart from him. If we were always careful to make our worship fit and appropriate for our great Lord how much better should we sing! How much more reverently should we adore! Such excellent deeds should have excellent praise.</span></p>

Make all men to know that we are not ashamed to worship. Summon them with unmistakable sound to bow before their God. The sound of trumpet is associated with the grandest and most solemn events, such as the giving of the law, the proclamation of jubilee, the coronation of Jewish kings, and the raging of war. It is to be thought of in reference to the coming of our Lord in his second advent and the raising of the dead. If we cannot give voice to this martial instrument, at least let our praise be as decided and bold as if we could give a blast upon the horn. Let us never sound a trumpet before us to our own honour, but reserve all our trumpeting for God&#39;s glory. When the people have been gathered by blast of trumpet, then proceed to <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>psaltery </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>harp.&quot; </span>Stringed instruments are to be used as well as those which are rendered vocal by wind. Dulcet notes are to be consecrated as well as more startling sounds. The gospel meaning is that all powers and faculties should praise the Lord&#8212;all sorts of persons, under all circumstances, and with differing constitutions, should do honour unto the Lord of all. If there be any virtue, if there be any talent, if there be any influence, let all be consecrated to the service of the universal Benefactor. Harp and lyre&#8212;the choicest, the sweetest, must be all our Lord&#39;s.</p>

The hands and the feet were both employed, and the entire body moved in sympathy with the members. Are there not periods of life when we feel so glad that we would fain dance for joy; Let not such exhilaration be spent upon common themes, but let the name of God stir us to ecstasy. Let us exult as we cry.&#8212;</p>

Nothing is common and unclean : all may be sanctified to highest uses. Many men, many minds, and these as different as strings and pipes; but there is only one God, and that one God all should worship. The word translated &quot; organs&quot; signifies pipe&#8212;a simpler form of wind instrument than the more modern and more elaborate organ. Doubtless many a pious shepherd has poured out gracious pastorals from a reed or oaten pipe, and so has magnified his God.</p>

Here we see David, or rather the human heart itself with all its God-given notes of grief, joy, tears, and adoration&#8212;poetry sanctified to its highest expression; a vase of perfume broken on the step of the temple, and shedding abroad its odours from the heart of David to the heart of all humanity! Hebrew, Christian, or even Mohammedan, every religion, every complaint, every prayer has taken from this vase, shed on the heights of Jerusalem, wherewith to give forth their accents. The little shepherd has become the master of the sacred choir of the Universe. There is not a worship on earth which prays not with his words, or sings not with his voice. A chord of his harp is to be found in all choirs, resounding everywhere and for ever in unison with the echoes of Horeb and Engedi! David is the Psalmist of eternity; what a destiny&#8212;what a power hath poetry when inspired by God! As for myself, when my spirit is excited, or devotional, or sad, and seeks for an echo to its enthusiasm, its devotion, or its melancholy, I do not open Pindar or Horace, or Hafiz, those purely Academic poets: neither do I find within myself murmurings to express my emotion. I open the Book of Psalms, and there I find words which seem to issue from the soul of the ages, and which penetrate even to the heart of<a id='GBS.PA452.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.471.1.0.box.231.257.1302.428.q.60'>
all generations. Happy the bard who has thus become the eternal hymn, the personified prayer and complaint of all humanity! If we look back to that remote age when such songs resounded over the world ; if we consider that while the lyric poetry of all the most cultivated nations only sang of wine, love, blood, and the victories of coursers at the games of Elidus, we are seized with profound astonishment at the mystic accents of the shepherd prophet, who speaks to God the Creator as one friend to another, who understands and praises his great works, admires his justice, implores his mercy, and becomes, as it were, an anticipative echo of the evangelic poetry, speaking the soft words of Christ before his coming. Prophet or not, as he may be considered by Christian or sceptic, none can deny in the poet-kin an inspiration granted to no other man. Read Greek or Latin poetry after a psalm, and see how pale it looks.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Swan </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Plumer. </span></span></p>

Thus, in Ps. xlv. 8, we would read, &quot; Out of the ivory palaces <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(i.e. </span>concerts of music) have made thee glad &quot; ; and so in Ps. cl. 4, &quot;Praise him with <span style='font-style:italic;'>strings </span>(stringed instruments), and <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ugabs.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kitto. </span></p>
<a id='GBS.PA455.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.474.1.2.box.263.766.1300.921.q.50'><span style='font-style:italic;'>Verse </span>4.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Organs.&quot; </span>ajy?, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ugab </span>is the word rendered &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>organ&quot; </span>in our version. The Targum renders the word simply by N3UN, <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pipe</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>the Septuagint varies, it has <span style='font-style:italic;'>tudapa </span>in Genesis, ;.&#39;&#39;.&lt;/ &lt;.&#39;..i&#39; in Job, and <span style='font-style:italic;'>dp-yavov </span>in the Psalms. The last is the sense which the Arabic, Syriac, Latin, English, and most other versions have adopted. The <span style='font-style:italic;'>organon </span>simply denotes a double or manifold pipe; and hence, in particular, the Pandtean or shepherd&#39;s pipe, which is at this day called a &quot; mouth organ,&quot; among ourselves. <span style='font-style:italic;'>(Kitto.) </span>A collection of tubes of different sizes, stopped at one end and blown at the other, forms the musical instrument known as Pan&#39;s pipes, in the Greek <span style='font-style:italic;'>syrinx, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>avpvvf </span>.... Was the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ugab </span>a <span style='font-style:italic;'>syrinx </span>or an organ? As the former seems to have been the more ancient of the two, and as <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ugab </span>is included in the very first allusion to musical instruments in the Bible, it would seem reasonable to say at once that it was a <span style='font-style:italic;'>syrinx, </span>especially as this instrument was, and is to this day, commonly met with in various parts of Asia. &#39;Yet it would, indeed, be strange if such an instrument were selected for use in divine worship; and that the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ugab </span>was so used is proved beyond a doubt by its mention in Ps. cl. : &quot;Praise him with the <span style='font-style:italic;'>minnim </span>and &#39;&#8226;&lt;&lt;/,&lt;&#39;.. Its mention here in antithesis to a collective name for stringed instruments, surely points to the fact of its being a more important instrument than a few river-reeds fixed together with wax. Let us not forget that we have but one and the same name for the single row of about fifty pipes, placed, perhaps, in a little room, and the mighty instrument of five thousand pipes, occupying as much space as an ordinary dwellinghouse. . . . Each is an organ. May it not have been the case that the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;ugab, </span>which in Gen. iv. 21 is mentioned as the simply-constructed wind-instrument, in contrast to the simple <span style='font-style:italic;'>stringed-</span>instrument, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Jnnnor, </span>was a greatly inferior instrument to that which in Ps. cl. is thought worthy of mention by the side of a term for the whole string power <span style='font-style:italic;'>1&#8212;J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stainer. </span></p>

Zeal does very well&#8212;there is great, yea, necessary use for it in every part of God&#39;s service. The cymbal will be flat, it will have no life or spirit in it, it will not be loud enough without it. But if meekness, peaceableness, and moderation do not first put the cymbal into good tune, the loudness will but make it the more ungrateful in the player, the more ungrateful to the hearer.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sanderson, </span>1587 &#8212;1662.</p>

From the simple idea of wind instruments, mentioned in the context, it leads us, by a beautiful transition, to that of vocal, articulate, intelligent praise, uttered by the breath of living men, as distinguished from mere lifeless instruments. Then, lastly, by a natural association, we ascend to the idea expressed in the common version, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>everything </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>breath,&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>not merely all that lives, but all that has a voice to praise God.
