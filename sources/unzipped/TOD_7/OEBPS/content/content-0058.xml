our supplications are such that we find pleasure in looking back upon them. He that is cheered by the memory of his prayers will pray again. See how the good man&#39;s appeal was to Jehovah only : he did not go round about to men, but he ran straight forward to Jehovah, his God. What true wisdom is here! Consider how the Psalmist&#39;s prayer grew into shape as he proceeded with it. He first poured out his natural longings,&#8212;&quot; I cried &quot; ; and then he gathered up all his wits and arranged his thoughts,&#8212;&quot;I made supplication.&quot; True prayers may differ in their diction, but not in their direction : an impromptu cry and a preconceived supplication must alike ascend towards the one prayer-hearing God, and he will accept each of them with equal readiness. The intense personality of the prayer is noteworthy : no doubt the Psalmist was glad of the prayers of others, but he was not content to be silent himself. See how everything is in the first person,&#8212;&quot;/cried with <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>voice; with <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>voice did <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>make <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>supplication.&quot; It is good to pray in the plural&#8212;&quot; Our Father,&quot; but in times of trouble we shall feel forced to change our note into &quot; Let this cup pass from <span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span></span></p>

He must pour out the wormwood and the gall, he could not keep it in; he lets it run away as best it can, that so his heart may be emptied of the fermenting mixture. But he took care <span style='font-style:italic;'>where </span>he outpoured his complaint, lest he should do mischief, or receive an ill return. If he poured it out before man he might only receive contempt from the proud, hard-heartedness from the careless, or pretended sympathy from the false; and therefore he resolved upon an outpouring before God alone, since <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span>would pity and relieve. The word is scarcely &quot; complaint&quot; ; but even if it be so we may learn from this text that our complaint must never be of a kind that we dare not bring before God. We may complain <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span>God, but not <span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span>God. When we complain it should not be before men, but before God alone. &quot;7 <span style='font-style:italic;'>shewed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trouble.&#39;&#39; </span>He exhibited his griefs to one who could assuage them: he did not fall into the mistaken plan of so many who publish their sorrows to those who cannot help them. This verse is parallel with the first; David first pours out his complaint, letting it flow forth in a natural, spontaneous manner, and then afterwards he makes a more elaborate show of his affliction ; just as in the former verse he began with crying, and went on to &quot;make supplication.&quot; Praying men pray better as they proceed.

Pour out your thoughts and you will see what they are; show your trouble and the extent of it will be known to you : let all be done before the Lord, for in comparison with his great majesty of love the trouble will seem to be as nothing.</p>

A heavy fog settles down upon the mind, and the man seems drowned and smothered in it; covered with a cloud, crushed with a load, confused with difficulties, conquered by impossibilities. David was a hero, and yet his spirit sank : he could smite a giant down, but he could not keep himself up. He did not know his own path, nor feel able to bear his own burden. Observe his comfort: he looked away from his own condition to the ever-observant, all-knowing God : and solaced himself with the fact that all was known to his heavenly Friend. Truly it is well for us to know that God knows what we do not know. We lose our heads, but God never closes his eyes: our judgments lose their balance, but the eternal mind is always clear.</p>

who dwells in the secret place of the Most High, for he shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. The use of concealed traps is disgraceful to our enemies, but they care little to what tricks they resort for their evil purposes. Wicked men must find some exercise for their malice, and therefore when they dare not openly assail they will privately ensnare. They watch the gracious mail to see where his haunt is, and there they set their trap; but they do it with great caution, avoiding all observation, lest their victim being forewarned should &#39;escape their toils. This is a great trial, but the Lord is greater still, and makes us to walk safely in the midst of danger, for he knows us and our enemies, our way and the snare which is laid in it. Blessed be his name.</span></p>

Surely some helper would be found in the place of honour; some one would stand at his right hand to undertake his defence. He looked steadily, and saw all that could be seen, for he &quot; beheld &quot; ; but his anxious gaze was not met by an answering smile. Strange to say, all were strange to David. He had known many, but none would know him. When a person is in ill odour it is wonderful how weak the memories of his former friends become: they quite forget, they refuse to know. This is a dire calamity. It is better to be opposed by foes than to be forsaken by friends. When friends look for us they affect to have known us from our birth, but when we look for friends it is wonderful how little we can make them remember: the fact is that in times of desertion it is not true that no man did know us, but no man <span style='font-style:italic;'>would </span>know us. Their ignorance is wilful. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Refuge </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>failed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.</span>&quot; Wherein happier days I found a ready harbour I now discovered none at all.

I was cast out as an outcast. No soul cared for my soul. I dwelt in No-man&#39;s land, where none cared to have me, and none cared about me. This is an ill-plight&#8212;no place where to lay our head, and no head willing to find us a place. How pleased were his enemies to see the friend of God without a friend! How sad was he to be utterly deserted in his utmost need! Can we not picture David in the cave, complaining that even the cave was not a refuge for him, for Saul had come even there? Hopeless was his looking out, we shall soon see him looking up.</p>

This is the second time that in this short psalm we find the same record, &quot; I cried unto thee, O <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>&quot; : the saintly man is evidently glad to remember his cry and its results. We hear often of the bitter cry of outcast Ijondon, here <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Ib </span>another bitter cry, and it comes from an outcast, in wretched lodgings, forgotten by those who should have helped him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Isaid, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>refuge </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>por</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tion </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>land </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>living.&quot; </span>There is a sort of progressive repetition all through this sacred song; he <span style='font-style:italic;'>cried </span>first, but he <span style='font-style:italic;'>said </span>afterwards: his cry was bitter, but his saying was sweet; his cry was sharp and short, but his saying was fresh and full. It gives a believer great pleasure to remember his own believing speeches: he may well desire to bury his unbelieving murmurings in oblivion, but the triumphs of grace in working in him a living faith, he will not dream of forgetting. What a grand confession of faith was this! David spoke to God, and of God&#8212; -<sup>&#39;</sup>- Tuou art my refuge.&quot; Not thou hast provided me a refuge, but thou, thyself, art my refuge. He fled to God alone; he hid himself beneath the wings of the Eternal. He not only believed this, but said it, and practised it. Nor was this all; for David, when banished from his portion in the promised land, and cut off from the portion of goods which he by right inherited, found his portion in God, yea, God <span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span>his portion. This was so not only in reference to a future state, but here among living men. It is sometimes easier to believe in a portion in heaven than in a portion upon earth : we could die more easily than live, at least we think so. But there is no living in the land of the living like living upon the liv<a id='GBS.PA296.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.315.1.0.box.255.236.1299.107.q.60'>ing God. For the man of God to say these precious things in the hour of his dire distress was a grand attainment. It is easy to prate bravely when we dwell at ease, but to speak confidently in affliction is quite another matter.</span></p>

This is his argument with God : he is reduced to such a sad condition that if he be not rescued he will be ruined. Gracious men may not only be low, but very low; and this should not be a reason for their doubting the efficacy of their prayers, but rather a plea with the Lord why they should have special attention. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Deliver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>persecutors.&quot; </span>If he did not get out of their hands, they would soon kill him out of hand, and as he could not himself effect an escape, he cried to God, &quot;deliver me.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stronger </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span>/.&quot; As he before found a plea in his sadness, so now in his feebleness: Saul and his courtiers were in power, and could command the aid of all who sought royal favour; but poor David was in the cave, and every Nabal girded at him. Saul was a monarch, and David a fugitive; Saul had all the forms of law on his side, while David was an outlaw : so that the prayer before us comes from the weak, who proverbially go to the wall,&#8212;a good place to go to if they turn their faces to it in prayer, as Hezekiah did in his sickness. The Lord is wont to take the side of the oppressed, and to show his power by baffling tyrants; David&#39;s supplication was therefore sure to speed. lu these sentences we see how explicitly the man of God described his case in his private communings with his Lord : in real earnest he poured out his complaint before him. and showed before him his trouble.</p>

Escaped prisoners are sure to speak well of those who give them liberty. Soul-emancipation is the noblest form of liberation, and calls for the loudest praise: he who is delivered from the dungeons of despair is sure to magnify the name of the Lord. We are in such a prison that only God himself can bring us out of it, and when he does so be will put a new song into our mouths. The cave was not half such a dungeon to David&#39;s body as persecution and temptation made for his soul. To be exiled from the godly is worse than imprisonment, hence David makes it one point of his release that he would be restored to church fellowship&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>com</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pass </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>about.&#39;&#39; </span>Saints gather around a child of God when his Father smiles upon him ; they come to hear his joyful testimony, to rejoice with him, aud to have their own faith encouraged. All the true believers in the twelve tribes were glad to rally to David&#39;s banner when the Lord enlarged his spirit; they glorified God for him and with him and through him. They congratulated him, consorted with him, crowned him, and championed him. This was a sweet experience for righteous David, who had for awhile come under the censure of the upright. He bore their smiting with patience, and now he welcomes their sanction with gratitude. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deal </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bountifully </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>God&#39;s bountiful dealing is sure to bring with it the sympathy and alliance of all the favourites of the Great King. What a change from looking for a friend and finding none to this enthusiastic concourse of allies around the man after God&#39;s own heart! When we can begin a psalm with crying, wo may hope to close it with singing. The voice of prayer soon awakens the voice of praise.</p>

He expressly mentions his being in a place where he was entirely shut up, where he saw no possible method of escaping, as having no friends that dared to own him and appear for his deliverance, and when every one seemed to desert him, and to have abandoned all care of his safety and life. This he pathetically describes, and in such terms as cannot fail to move the tender affections of every one who considers them. On the first sense of his danger, shut up in a cave, surrounded by three thousand chosen soldiers, closely observed by a watchful enemy who would spare no art or pains to apprehend him, he seems almost to have despaired of himself, and declares that his spirit is quite overwhelmed with the greatness of his distress. At length, recollecting his principles, and the promises that God had made him, he earnestly supplicates the protection of God, and assures himself that he should yet praise God for his deliverance, and that good men should share his joy, and encompass the altar of God with thanksgiving for the mercy that he had shown him.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Sam</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>uel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Chandler. </span></p>

At length, from a great rock hanging on the edge of the shelf, we entered by a long leap a low window which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the traditional hold of David, and, creeping half doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern, 1 Sam. xxii. 1,2; 2 Sam. xxiii. 13&#8212;17. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had time to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lionhearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance&#8212;would not have even attempted it. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thompson. </span></p>

Before God we may speak out our minds fully, and name the persons that afflict, affront, and trouble us ; and woe to them that a child of God upon a mature judgment names in prayer! 1 find not that such a prayer in Scripture ever returned empty ... A great reason why we reap so little benefit in prayer is, because we rest too much in generals; and if we have success, it is but dark, so that often we cannot tell what to make of the issues of prayer.

There are sorrows so far reaching, so universal; there are losses so absolute, and blows so terrible and inexplicable, that it seems for a time as if we were wrapped in thickest gloom, and as if the secret of the Lord had not been revealed. Why was this man stricken, and that man spared? Why was such and such a being, in whom so many hopes centred, or who had already realised so many pleasant expectations, why was he withdrawn? Why was that other person left, a useless encumbrance to earth? Why was that voice, which found echo in so many hearts, suddenly silenced <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>Why have I been smitten? Why have I lost that which rendered my moral life beautiful and useful? Oftentimes the soul seems lost for awhile in thoughts which overwhelm it, it loses its foothold, it tumbles about helplessly amid the deep waters of affliction. It seems as if all were over. Do not believe it. Remember Job; you cannot go to greater lengths of despair than he, and yet God had pity on him. There is much comfort for you in this example of indescribable suffering, exasperated to the highest degree, and yet pardoned and consoled. Cling to the memory of this blessed fact as to a cable of deliverance, a board or a plank amidst the shipwreck. And then remember that affliction forms part of God&#39;s plan, and that he also asks you to manifest ready and absolute confidence in him.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>E. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>De </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Pressense, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mystery </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Suffering,&quot; </span>1869.</p>

Here is a refuge for yOu; here is one open door; come in, thou blessed of the Lord: &quot;the Lord gathereth the outcasts of Israel &quot;: Ps. cxlvii. 2. It seems the Lord minds to have you in: he is doing with you as a father with a stubborn son who ran away from his father&#39;s house, thinking to shift for himself among his friends, and not come back : the father sends peremptory word through them all, saying, &quot;In whosesoever house my son is skulking, presently turn him out of doors, and let none of you take him in; and if he come to you give him not one night&#39;s lodging, nay, let him not eat in your house.&quot; Wherefore is all this but just to get him back again to his father&#39;s house ?&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Boston, </span>1676&#8212;1732.</p>

This is a deed never to be forgotten, but always to be kept in remembrance. But, O ye who have said this, remember, 1. <span style='font-style:italic;'>What </span>you said. You said that God in Christ should be your refuge, that under the shade of his wings you hid yourselves, and that, renouncing all other refuges, as refuges of lies, you did betake yourselves to the covert of Christ&#39;s righteousness, and that there ye would abide for your portion; which was a formal acceptance of and laying hold on the covenant. 2. <span style='font-style:italic;'>To </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span>you said it. To God in Christ speaking to you in the gospel-offer, and inviting you into the refuge. What men say to their superiors, they think themselves specially concerned to mind. And surely what ye have said to God, ye ought in a peculiar manner to remember, and awe your hearts with the consideration of the majesty of the party to whom ye said it, Ps. xvi. 2: &quot;O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord &quot; ; for he is not one with whom we may deal falsely. 3. <span style='font-style:italic;'>How </span>ye said it. Did ye not say it in your hearts, while God in Christ was held out as a refuge for you? And the language of the heart is plain language with a heart-searching God. Did not some of you say it with your mouths? and did not all communicants say it solemnly before the world, angels, and men, by their receiving the elements of bread and wine? 4. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Upon, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>what </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grounds </span>you said it. Did you not see a necessity of a refuge for you, and a necessity of taking God in Christ for your refuge? Ye had rational grounds for it, and lasting grounds that can never fail ; so that ye can never have ground to retract nor shift about for another refuge. Jer. ii. 31. 5. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Where </span>ye said it. Remember the spot of ground where ye said it in prayer, where ye said it at the communion-table. Ps. xlii. 6. The stones of the place will be witnesses of your saying it. Josh. xxiv. 27.</p>

A <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Standing </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>To </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>It, </span>without regretting that we said it, remembering what is said, John vi. 66&#8212;69: &quot;From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; Men often repent what they have said, and therefore will not own that they have said it. But gracious souls will not repent their saying this, but will abide by it. If they were to make their choice a thousand times, having chosen God in Christ for their refuge and portion, they would not alter; Jer. iii. 19: &quot;I said, Thou shalt call me, My Father; and shalt not turn away from me.&quot; Many alterations may be in men&#39;s circumstances in the world, but there can never be one that will afford ground for retracting this saying.</p>

God in Christ is yours, and ye are his by his own consent; ye are no more your own; ye have said the word, and must own that it is binding on you; and ye must beware that after vows ye make not enquiry. Whoever may pretend they have their choice yet to make of a refuge and portion to themselves, ye cannot : ye are engaged already, and ye are not at liberty to hearken to any other proposals, any more than a woman who has already signed her contract with one man.</p>
