Having experienced God&#39;s kindness in so many ways, he calls him &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>goodness,&quot; </span>meaning that whatever good he possessed flowed from him. The accumulation of terms, one upon another, which follows, may appear unnecessary, yet it tends greatly to strengthen faith.

The word translated <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;fortress&quot; </span>is <span style='font-style:italic;'>meteudah </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>masada. </span>From 1 Sam. xxiii. 29, I have no doubt that he is speaking of Masada, an isolated peak 1500 feet high, on which was a stronghold.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wareing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bardsley, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Glimpses </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>through </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Veil,&quot; </span>1883.</p>

A warrior took it with him when he used his bow or his sword. It was often made of metal, but still was portable, and useful, and was made to serve as an ornament, being brightened or anointed with oil.

It has not escaped the notice of the royal Psalmist, who, in a beautiful ascription of praise to the living and the true God, entreats that the sheep of his chosen people might &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>bring </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thousands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ten </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thousands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>streets.&quot; </span>In another song of Zion, he represents, by a very elegant metaphor, the numerous flocks covering like a garment the face of the field :&#8212;&quot; The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing&quot;: Ps. Ixv. 13. The bold figure is fully warranted by the prodigious numbers of sheep which whitened the extensive pastures of Syria and Canaan. In that part of Arabia which borders on Judea, the patriarch Job possessed at first seven thousand, and after the return of his prosperity, fourteen thousand sheep; and Mesha, the king of Moab, paid the king of Israel &quot; a yearly tribute of a hundred thousand lambs, and an equal number of rams with the wool &quot; : 2 Kings iii. 4. In the war which the tribe of Reuben waged with the Hagarites, the former drove away &quot; two hundred and fifty thousand sheep&quot; : 1 Chron. v. 21. At the dedication of the temple, Solomon offered in sacrifice &quot; an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.&quot; At the feast of the passover, Josiah, the king of Judah,. &quot;gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings,<a id='GBS.PA345.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.364.1.0.box.197.261.1303.391.q.60'>
for all that were present, tp the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king&#39;s substance&quot; : 2 Chron. xxxv. 7. The ewe brings forth her young commonly once a year, and in more ungenial climes, seldom more than one lamb at a time. But twin lambs are as frequent in the oriental regions, as they are rare in other places; which accounts in a satisfactory manner for the prodigious numbers which the Syrian shepherd led to the mountains. This uncommon fruitfulness seems to be intimated by Solomon in his address to the spouse :&#8212;&quot; Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them&quot; : Cant. iv. 2.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Paxton </span>(1762&#8212;1837), <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Illustrations </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Scripture.&quot; </span></span></p>

meditations. In other psalms it is set in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>front, </span>or first place of all; as in the xxxii., in the cxii., in the cxix., and in the cxxviii. Again, in this the Psalmist ends with <span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span>happiness and begins with God&#39;s. &quot;Blessed be the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lobd </span>my strength.&quot; In the 4lst Psalm, contrary, he makes his <span style='font-style:italic;'>exordium </span>from <span style='font-style:italic;'>man&#39;s; </span>&quot;Blessed is he that considereth the poor&quot; ; his <span style='font-style:italic;'>conclusion </span>with <span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;s</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>&quot;Blessed be the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>God of Israel.&quot; I therefore observe these variations, because they are helpful to the understanding both of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>essence </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>splendour </span>of true happiness. To the knowledge of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>essence </span>they help, because they demonstrate how our own happiness is enfolded in the glory of God, and subordinate unto it. As we cannot begin with <span style='font-style:italic;'>beatus </span>unless we end with <span style='font-style:italic;'>benedietus</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>so we must begin with <span style='font-style:italic;'>benedictus </span>that we may end with <span style='font-style:italic;'>beatus. </span>The reason is this,&#8212;because the glory of God is as well the <span style='font-style:italic;'>consummation </span>as the <span style='font-style:italic;'>introduction </span>to a Christian&#39;s happiness. Therefore as in the other psalm he begins below and ends upwards; so in this, having begun from above with that which is principal, &quot;Blessed be the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lobd </span>&quot;; he fixcth his second thoughts upon the subordinate, &quot; Blessed, or happy, are the people.&quot; He could not proceed in a better order: he first looks up to <span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;s </span>kingdom, then reflects upon his own, as not meaning to <span style='font-style:italic;'>take </span>blessedness before he had <span style='font-style:italic;'>given </span>it.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Holdsworth. </span></span></p>

The person to whom Solomon attributes this right and left hand is Wisdom; and a wise man may reach out his right and left hand, to receive the blessings of both sorts.

It is not an <span style='font-style:italic;'>absolute </span>revocation, but a <span style='font-style:italic;'>comparative</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>it doth not ximply deny that there is some part of popular happiness in these outward things, but it prefers the spirituals before them: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yea,&quot; </span>that is. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Yea </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>more, </span>or, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Yea </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rather</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>like that of Christ in the Oospel, when one in the company blessed the womb that bare him, he presently replies, &quot;Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it&quot;: Luke xi. 28. In like manner, the prophet David, having first premised the inferior part and outside of a happy condition; fearing lest any should of purpose mistake his meaning, and, hearing the first proposition, should either there set up their rest, and not at all take up the second ; or if they take it in, do it preposterously, and give it the precedence before the second, according to the world&#39;s order, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Virtus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>post </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nummos. </span>In this respect he puts in the clause of revocation, whereby he shows that these outward things, though <span style='font-style:italic;'>named </span>first, yet they are not to be <span style='font-style:italic;'>reputed </span>first. The particle <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yea&quot; </span>removes them to the second place; it tacitly transposeth the order; and the path of piety, which was <span style='font-style:italic;'>locally </span>after, it placeth <span style='font-style:italic;'>virtually </span>before. &#39;Tis as if he had said, Did I call them <span style='font-style:italic;'>happy </span>who are in such a case? Nay, miserable are they if they be only in such a case: the temporal part cannot make them so without the spiritual. Admit the windows of the visible heaven were opened, and all outward blessings poured down upon us; admit we did perfectly enjoy whatsoever the vastness of the earth contains in it; tell me, What will it profit to gain all and lose God? If the earth be bestowed upon us, and not heaven ; or the material heaven be opened, and not the beatifical; or the whole world made ours, and God not ours; we do not arrive at happiness. All that is in the first proposition is nothing unless this be added, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Yea, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nappy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Holdsworth. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Verse </span>15.&#8212;</p>
