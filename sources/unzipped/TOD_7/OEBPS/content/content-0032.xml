It is a good observation, that the world is round, but the heart of man is triangular. Now, all the globe of the world will not fill the triangular heart of man. What of the world and in the world can give quietness, when Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, goes down upon the soul? The heart is a three-square, and nothing but a trinity in. unity and a unity in trinity will satisfy this. Not riches, nor relations, nor barns, nor bags, will satisfy a convinced and deserted soul. This person can say concerning his bags as a great person upon a sick, if not a dying, bed, did concerning his bags,&#8212;Away, and away for ever. Though there be bag upon bag, yet they are altogether insignificant in a dying hour; these bags, they are but as so many ciphers before a figure.

How painfully David felt what he conceived to be a dishonouring of God, which he thought he might be able to remedy. Consider &quot;his afflictions,&quot;&#8212;because the ark dwelt within curtains, while he himself dwelt in a house of cedar: 2 Sam. vii. 2. Consider, 1. Its singularity. Most find affliction in personal losses ; very few suffer from a cause like this. 2. The little sympathy such a feeling meets with from the most of men. &quot;If God means to convert the heathen, he can do it without you, young man,&quot; was said to Dr., then Mr. Carey, when heathenism was an affliction to him. 3. Its fittingness to a really God-fearing man. 4. Its pleusingness to God: 1 Sam. ii. 30. II. How earnestly he set himself to remedy the evil he deplored: &quot;He sware,&quot; etc. There cannot be the least doubt that he would have foregone the enjoyment of temporal luxuries until he had accomplished the work dear to his heart, if he had been permitted of God. Remark, 1. There is little zeal for God&#39;s honour when selfdenial is not exercised for the sake of his cause. 2. Were a like zeal generally shown by God&#39;s people, there would be more givers and more liberal gifts; more workers, and the work more heartily and better done. 3. It would be well to astonish the world, and deserve the commendations of the righteous by becoming enthusiasts for the honour of God.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>F. </span></p>

We should be guided by the house of God in seeking a house for ourselves: &quot;Surely I will not come,&quot; etc. III. We should labour for the prosperity of God&#39;s house even more than of our own. Nothing should make sleep more sweet to us than when the church of God prospers; nothing keep us more awake than when it declines: &quot;I will not give sleep,&quot; etc. (verse 4); &quot;Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie waste ?&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>G. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>S. </span></p>
