Sing a hymn newly composed, for you have now a new knowledge of God. He is ever new in his manifestations; his mercies are new every morning; his deliverances are new in every night of sorrow; let your gratitude and thanksgivings be new also. It is well to repeat the old; it is more useful to invent the new. Novelty goes well with heartiness. Our singing should be &quot; unto the Lord &quot; ; the songs we sing should be of him and to him, &quot;for of him, and to him, and through him are all things.&quot; Among our novelties there should be new songs: alas! men are fonder of making new complaints than new psalms. Our new songs should be devised in Jehovah&#39;s honour ; indeed all our newest thoughts should run towards him. Never can we find a nobler subject for a song than the Lord, nor one more full of fresh matter for a new song, nor one which we are personally so much bound to sing as a new song &quot; unto the Lord.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pratse </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>congregation </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saints.&quot; </span>Saints are precious, and a congregation of saints is a treasure house of jewels. God is in the midst of saints, and because of this we may well long to be among them. They are so full of his praise that we feel at home among them when we are ourselves full of praise. The sanctuary is the house of praise as well as the house of prayer. All<a id='GBS.PA438.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.457.1.0.box.211.286.1302.355.q.60'>
sainta praise God: they would not be saints if they did not. Their praise is sincere, suitable, seasonable, and acceptable. Personal praise is sweet unto God, but congregated praise has a multiplicity of sweetnesses in it. When holy ones meet, they adore The Holy One. Saints do not gather to amuse themselves with music, nor to extol one another, but to sing his praise whose saints they are. A congregation of saints is heaven upon earth : should not Jehovah, the Lord of saints, have all the praise that can come from such an assembly? Yet at times even saintly conclaves need to be stirred up to thanksgiving; for saints may be sad and apprehensive, and then their spirits require to be raised to a higher key, and stimulated to happier worship.</span></p>

It was Jehovah who made Israel to be Israel, and the tribes to become a great nation : therefore let the Founder of the nation be had in perpetual honour. Joy and rejoicing are evidently to be the special characteristics of the new song. The religion of the dead in sin is more apt to chant dirges than to sing hallelujahs; but when we are made new in the spirit of our minds we joy and rejoice in him that made us. Our joy is in our God and King: we choose no lower delight. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>children </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Zion </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>joyful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>King.&#39;&#39; </span>Those who had seen the tribes formed into a settled kingdom as well as into a united nation should rejoice. Israel is the nation, Zion is the capital of the kingdom: Israel rejoices in her Maker, Ziou in her King. In the case of our God we who believe in him are as glad of his Government as we are of his Creation: his reign is as truly the making of us as was his divine power. The children of Israel are happy to be made a people ; the children of Zion are equally happy to be ruled as a people. In every character our God is the source of joy to us: this verse issues a permit to our joy, yea it lays an injunction upon us to be glad in the Lord.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA438.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.457.1.2.box.214.1207.1307.745.q.60'>3. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thempraise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dance: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praises </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>timbrel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>harp.&quot; </span>Thus let them repeat the triumph of the Red Sea, which was ever the typical glory of Israel. Miriam led the daughters of Israel in the dance when the Lord had triumphed gloriously; was it not most fit that she should? The sacred dance of devout joy is no example, nor even excuse, for frivolous dances, much less for lewd ones. Who could help dancing when Egypt was vanquished, and the tribes were free? Every mode of expressing delight was bound to be employed on so memorable an occasion. Dancing, singing, and playing on instruments were all called into requisition, and most fitly so. There are unusual seasons which call for unusual expressions of joy. When the Lord saves a soul its holy joy overflows, and it cannot find channels enough for its exceeding gratitude : if the man does not leap, or play, or sing, at any rate he praises God, and wishes for a thousand tongues with which to magnify his Saviour. Who would wish it to be otherwise? Young converts are not to be restrained in their joy. Let them sing and dance while they can. How can they mourn now that their Bridegroom is with them? Let us give the utmost liberty to joy. Let us never attempt its suppression, but issue in the terms of this verse a double license for exultation. If any ought to be glad it is the children of Zion; rejoicing is more fit for Israel than for any other people: it is their own folly and fault that they are not oftener brimming with joy in God, for the very thought of him is delight.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA438.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.457.1.3.box.218.1951.1303.391.q.60'>4. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>taketh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pleasure </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people&quot;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>and therefore they should take pleasure in him. If our joy be pleasing to him let us make it full. What condescension is this on Jehovah&#39;s part, to notice, to love, and to delight in his chosen! Surely there is nothing in our persons, or our actions, which could cause pleasure to the Ever-blessed One, were it not that be condescends to men of low estate. The thought of the Lord&#39;s taking pleasure in us is a mine of joy never to be exhausted. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>beautify </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>meek </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation.&quot; </span>They are humble, and feel their need of salvation; he is gracious, and bestows it upon them.

If confined by sickness let them joy in God. In the night watches let them not lie awake and weep, but like nightingales let them charm the midnight hours. Their shouts are not now for the battlefield, but for the places of their rest: they can peacefully lie down and yet enjoy the victory with which the Lord has beautified them. Without fighting, faith wins and sings the victory. What a blessing to have our beds made into thrones, and our retirements turned into triumphs!</p>

When called to fight, the meek are very hard to overcome ; they are just as steady in conflict as they are steadfast in patience. Besides, their way of fighting is of an extraordinary sort, for they sing to God but keep their swords in their hands. They can do two things at a time: if they do not wield the trowel and the sword, at least they sing and strike. In this Israel was not an example, but a type: we will not copy the chosen people in making literal war, but we will fulfil the emblem by carrying on spiritual war. We praise God and contend with our corruptions; we sing joyfully and war earnestly with evil of every kind. Our weapons are not carnal, but they are mighty, and wound with both back and edge. The word of God is all edge; whichever way we turn it, it strikes deadly blows at falsehood and wickedness. If we do not praise we shall grow sad in our conflict; and if we do not fight we shall become presumptuous in our song. The verse indicates a happy blending of the chorister and the crusader.</p>

The living God imparts vigorous life to those who trust him. They are not of a neutral tint: men both heat them and feel them. Quiet is their spirit, but in that very quietude abides the thunder of an irresistible force. When godly men give battle to the powers ol evil each conflict is high praise unto the God of goodness.

There were three kinds, differing, no doubt, in sound as well as in form; one was circular, another square or oblong, and the third consisted of two squares separated by a bar. They were all beaten by the hand, and often used as an accompaniment to the harp and other instruments.

First: the Lord takes pleasure in them, inasmuch as he delights in <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exercise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>graces </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>towards </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him. </span>They all believe in him, and have faith in his word aud promises; they rely on his truth and power; they hope in his mercy; they fear his displeasure; they love his person and name. Secondly: the Lord hath pleasure in <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>services </span>of his people. It is true, that they can do but little for him, and that little is nothing worth. At the best they can but render to him of his own again. But he regards their services, not with an eye to their intrinsic value in themselves, but for the sake of the willing mind from which they flow. He takes pleasure in their poor attempts to please him, because they are attempts. He weighs not the worth or merit of the action, but the principle and motive from which it springs. Thirdly: the Lord hath pleasure in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>prosperity </span>of his people. His name is love; his nature is goodness; and can we doubt but that he loves to see his people happy? Nay, we are expressly told that &quot; he rejoiceth over them with joy&quot; ; that &quot; he rejoiceth over them to do them good.&quot; Even in those dispensations which in themselves are grievous and painful he is seeking -their good, and in the end promoting their happiness. What consolations do these reflections furnish to the <span style='font-style:italic;'>meek </span>and suffering servants of the Lord!</p>

There are many passages in the Scripture which intimate this purpose, and lead us to this view of the happy effects of religion, even in the present life. When the prodigal returned home to his father&#39;s house, contrite, penitent, and reformed, he was not only received with kindness, assured of forgiveness, and welcomed as a son, but he was <span style='font-style:italic;'>adorned </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>beautified </span>(Luke xv. 22). So in the forty-fifth Psalm, the church, the bride of Christ, is thus described: &#39;&#39; The king&#39;s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold. She shall be brought unto&#39;the king in raiment of needlework.&quot; &quot;So shall he greatly desire thy <span style='font-style:italic;'>beauty.&quot; </span>See also Eph. v. 25&#8212;27.</p>

It is &quot; the beauty of holiness.&quot; We have already seen that the meek and quiet spirit by which the Christian is &#39;distinguished is an &quot; ornament&quot; to him; and we read in another place that he is &quot;adorned &quot; with good works. It is the great object of the gospel to sanctify all who embrace it, to restore them to the image of God which they have lost through sin.</p>

They are &quot; predestinated to be conformed to the image of the Son&quot; ; and when they awake up in another world, it will be after his likeness, without any remaining blemish, defect, or spot. Carry forward your thoughts to the morning of the resurrection, when this corruption shall have put on incorruption, this mortal immortality; when the body, raised in honour and glory, shall be clothed in its beauteous apparel, and being made like unto Christ&#39;s glorious body, shall shine as the sun in the.firmament; when now, once more united to its kindred and sanctified spirit, it shall no longer be a weight, and a clog, and a hindrance, but become a furtherer of its joy, and a sharer and a helper in its spiritual happiness. This is the meaning of the text, this is the <span style='font-style:italic;'>beauty </span>which he has designed for his people, and for which he is now preparing them.

David was not satisfied by offering the sacrifice of thanksgiving in the courts of the Lord&#39;s house, and paying his vows in the presence of all the people; but in the night also he would continue his song of God&#39;s mercy. Like that excellent bird, the nightingale, which is never weary nor spent by continuing her delightful notes, so this sweet singer of Israel was incessant in praising the Lord ; not giving sleep to his eyes until he had blessed his holy name. In time of affliction he made his bed to swim, praying unto the Lord to return and deliver his soul. Now in prosperity he gives thanks for the blessings he doth receive. When our bones are vexed, and our sleep departeth from us, we pray unto God to deal mercifully with us; but when our diseases are healed, we do not return to give thanks, being soon overtaken with heaviness and security. And yet David did endeavour to watch in the night, that he might sing praise unto the Lord. He did not then only meditate in the law of God, when he could not take any rest (as Ahasuerus had the book of the records of the Chronicles read before him, when he could not sleep) ; for now he might lie down in peace, and sleep, when God made him to dwell in safety. Much less did he intend to procure sleep by a sinister performance of any good duty, like those who, by singing, or reading, or hearing, or meditating, will have an unworthy aim to bring themselves asleep.

Cromwell&#39;s Ironsides were sneeringly called psalm-singers; but God&#39;s psalmsingers are always Ironsides. He who has a &quot;new song in his mouth&quot; is ever stronger, both to suffer and to labour, than the man who has a dumb spirit and a hymnless heart. When he sings at his work, he will both do more and do it better than he would without his song.

But the scope and nature of the duty prescribed in the text necessarily comprehends both&#8212;as well the high acts for which God is to be praised, as the high praises to be given unto God for those high acts; but especially the latter, namely, the height and excellency of the duty of praise to be performed for those high acts of God.

Oh how high must be that duty, that adds height to the high God, that magnifies the great God, and glorifies the God of glory, and makes him higher, greater, and more glorious than he was before!</span></p>

All that God doth and giveth; all that Christ doth and suffereth, is for the praise of the glory of his grace. I confess, consider men&#39;s highest praises of God, as they are man&#39;s performance, they are poor and inconsiderable things; but consider them as they are the testimonies and expressions of a believing heart, declaring and making known the unspeakable wisdom, faithfulness, bounty, and excellencies of God, exercised in his works; in this notion the Scripture declares the heart of God to be so taken with the desire of them, that he is willing to give heaven, earth, Himself, and Son to poor men for the praises of their hearts, hands, and tongues; and accounts himself abundantly satisfied. Therefore, when his people will speak good of his name, they speak of him in the dialect of angels&#39; notes, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>high </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praises </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&quot; </span></p>

Now the Lord, who is of the most perfect understanding, and deepest skill and knowledge, declares himself to take infinite delight in his people&#39;s praises. It is his solace and pleasure to be attended with them, either in earth or in heaven, by men or angels; and bis soul is ravished with the thoughts and contemplation of them.</p>
