Assyria had pillaged the nations till it had become rich with mountains of spoil, this was talked of among men as glory, but the psalmist despises such renown, and declares that the Lord was far more illustrious.

What a scene was that when Sennacherib&#39;s host was utterly destroyed in one night. The hands which were furious to pull down Jerusalem, could not even be raised from the sod, the most valiant warriors were as weak as the palsied cripples at the temple gate, yea, their eyes they could not open, a deep sleep sealed their vision in everlasting darkness. O God, how terrible are thou! Thus shalt thou right for us, and in the hour of peril overthrow the enemies of thy gospel. Therefore in thee will we trust and not be afraid.</p>

The Israelites always had a special fear of horses and scythed chariots; and, therefore, the sudden stillness of the entire force of the enemy in this department is made the theme of special rejoicing. The horses were stretched on the ground, and the chariots stood still, as if the whole camp had fallen asleep.

In the story we read how that Sennacherib&#39;s overthrow was from Hezekiah&#39;s prayer in the temple; for upon Sennncherib&#39;s letter, and Hezekiah&#39;s hearsay of the blasphemy, he took himself thither, went instantly into the temple, and began his prayer thus: &quot;O thou God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims.&quot; He invocates him under that style of his dwelling in the holiest, and sn hearing prayers there. Thus you have it recorded both in Isaiah and in 2 Kings xxix. 15. And how suitably, in answer hereunto, it is said here in the Psalm, that God gave forth sentence presently out of his tabernacle, yea, and that so suddenly too, as that the very execution is said to be done there, that is, from thence.

By these, good men are usually made much better and more approved, while they tend to exercise our patience, to quicken our devotion, to evidence our zeal and Christian fortitude, and to show to the whole world what love we bear to the truth, and how much we are willing to undergo for the honour of God. Till they have suffered something for it, truth is too apt to grow cheap and be less prized many times, even by those that are good men in the main; whereas we are apt on the contrary, never to value it at a higher rate, or to be more zealous for it, or to make better use of it, than when it is opposed and persecuted. What more truly beneficial therefore, or tending to the divine glory, than for God, who useth to bring good out of evil, to make use also of the opposers of his truth, to rouse up his servants whom he sees growing more remiss and negligent than they should be, and to suffer such temptations to assault them, by which their drowsy minds may be spurred on into a greater love and zeal for the truth, and a deeper sense of the divine benefit in it, and, in general, excited to the more diligent performance of their duty.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Pearson. </span>1684.</p>

It puts them upon many subtile devices and cunning stratagems, in frustrating of which the wisdom of God and his care of his Church is very much illustrated. 2. The wrath of wicked men impels them to many violent and forcible attempts upon the people of God to destroy them, and so gives him occasion to manifest his power in their defence. 3. It makes them sometimes fit to be his instruments in correcting his people, and so he vindicates himself from the suspicion of being a patron to sin in them that are nearest to him, and makes them that hate holiness promote it in his people, and them that intend them the greatest hurt, to do them the greatest good. 4. It administers occasion to him for the manifestation of the power of his grace in upholding the spirits of his people and the being of his church in despite of all that enemies can do against them. 5. It serves very much to adorn God&#39;s most signal undertakings for his people in the world. 6. It serves to manifest the glory of God&#39;s justice upon his people&#39;s enemies in the day when he rises up to avenge himself upon them, when he shall stand over them, lashing them with scorpions, and at every blow mind their former cruelties. Here, take that for your inhuman rage against my people at such a place, and that for your barbarous usage of them at such a time.

Never have the Lord&#39;s people had such awful impressions of the sovereignty of God, as when they have been in the furnace of man&#39;s wrath, then they become dumb with silence. When the Chaldean and Sabean robbers are let loose to plunder and spoil the substance of Job, he is made to view adorable sovereignty in it, saying, &quot;The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord.&quot; It is in such a case as this that God says to his own people, &quot;Be still, and know that I am God ; I will be exalted among the heathen.&quot; What work of God about the church is advanced by the wrath of men? I. His <span style='font-style:italic;'>discovering </span>work; for by the wind of man&#39;s wrath he separates between the precious and the vile, betwixt the chaff and the wheat. In the day of the Church&#39;s prosperity and quiet hypocrites and true believers are mingled together, like the chaff and the wheat in the barn door : but the Lord, like the husbandman, opens the door of his barn, and puts the wind of man&#39;s wrath through it, that the world may know which is which. O, sirs, much chaff is cast up already, both among ministers and professors; but it is like the wind and sieve may cast up much more yet ere all be done. 2. God&#39;s <span style='font-style:italic;'>purging </span>work is advanced among his own children by the wrath of men : there is much of the dross of corruption cleaves to the Lord&#39;s people while in the wilderness. Now, the Lord heats the furnace of man&#39;s wrath, and casts his people into it, that when he has tried them, he may bring them forth as gold. 3. God&#39;s <span style='font-style:italic;'>uniting </span>work is thereby advanced. In a time of peace and external tranquillity the sheep of Christ scatter and divide among themselves; but God lets loose the dogs upon them, and then the flock runs together; or like pieces of metal cast into the fire, they run together in a lump. 4. God&#39;s <span style='font-style:italic;'>enlarging </span>work, or his work of spreading the gospel, is sometimes advanced by the wrath of man. Acts viii. 1&#8212;5.

In Isai. xxviii. we are told that God will not be aye &quot; threshing his corn, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen. This cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.&quot; All this comfort is sure and certain, there is not the least peradventure about it, that the flame of man&#39;s wrath shall praise the Lord, and the<a id='GBS.PA409.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.424.1.0.box.153.294.1294.99.q.50'>

That victorious emperor Henry the Fourth, who had fought two-and-hfty pitched battles, fell to that poverty before he died, that he was forced to petition to be a prebend in the church of Spier, to maintain him in his old age. And Procopius reports of King Gillimer, who was a potent king of the Vandals, who was so low brought, as to intreat his friend to send him a sponge, a loaf of bread, and a harp ; a sponge to dry up his tears, a loaf of bread to maintain his life, and a harp to solace himself in his misery. Philip ie Comines reports of a Duke of Exeter, who though he had married Edward the Fourth&#39;s sister, yet he saw him in the Low Countries begging barefoot.
