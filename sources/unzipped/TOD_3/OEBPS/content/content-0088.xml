When thy saints come together for worship, these cruel men attack them with all the fury of lions. They have no respect for the most solemn gatherings, but intrude themselves and their blasphemies into our most hallowed meetings. How often in times of persecution or prevalent heresy has the church learned the meaning of such language. May the Lord spare us such misery. When hypocrites abound in the church, and pollute her worship, the case is parallel to that before us; Lord save us from so severe a trial. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>set </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ensigns </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>signs.&#39;&#39; </span>Idolatrous emblems used in war were set up over God&#39;s altar, as an insulting token of victory, and of contempt for the vanquished and their God. Papists, Arians, and the modern school of Neologians, have, in their day, set up their ensigns for signs. Superstition, unbelief, and carnal wsidom have endeavoured to usurp the place of Christ crucified, to the grief of the church of God. The enemies without do us small damage, but those within the church cause her serious harm; by supplanting the truth and placing error in its stead, they deceive the people, and lead multitudes to destruction. As a Jew felt a holy horror when he saw an idolatrous emblem set up in the holy place, even so do we when in a Protestant church we see the fooleries of Rome, and when from pulpits, once occupied by men of God, we hear philosophy and vain deceit.</p>

Thus in the olden times our sires dealt sturdy blows against the forests of error, and laboured hard to lay the axe at the root of the trees; but, alas! their sons appear to be quite as diligent to destroy the truth and to overthrow all that their fathers built up.

Such fair carving it was barbarous to hew in pieces, but the Vandals had no mercy and broke down all, with any weapon which came to hand. In these days men are using axes and sledge-hammers against the gospel and the church. Glorious truths, far more exquisite than the goodliest carving, are cavilled over and smashed by the blows of modern criticism. Truths which have upheld the afflicted and cheered the dying are smitten by pretentious Goths, who would be accounted learned, but know not the first principles of the truth. With sharp ridicule, and heavy blows of sophistry, they break the faith of some: and would, if it were possible, destroy the confidence of the elect themselves. Assyrians, Babylonians, and Romans are but types of spiritual foes who labour to crush the truth and the people of God.</p>

Could the powers of darkness have their way, a like fate would befall the church of Christ. &quot;Rase it,&quot; say they, &quot;rase it even to the foundation thereof.&quot; Defilement to the church is destruction; her foes would defile her till nothing of her purity, and consequently of her real self, remained. Yet, even if they could wreak their will upon the cause of Christ, they are not able tn destroy it, it would survive their blows and fires; the Lord would hold them still like dogs in a leash, and in the end frustrate all their designs.</span></p>

Pharaoh&#39;s policy to stamp out the nation has been a precedent for others, yet the Jews survive, and will : the bush though burning has not been consumed. Even thus, the church of Christ has gone through baptisms of blood and fire, but it is all the brighter for them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hare </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>burned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><i>the </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>synagogues </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>land.<sup>&quot;</sup> </span>Here is no allusion to places called synagogues, but to assemblies; and as no assemblies for worship were held in but one place, the ruin of the temple was the destruction of all the holy gatherings, and so in effect all the meeting-places were destroyed. One object of persecutors has always been to put an end to all conventicles, as they have called them. Keep them from meeting and you will scatter them, so have the foemen said ; but. glory be to God, saints are independent of walls, and have met on the hill side, by the moss, or in the catacombs, or in a boat at sea. Yet has the attempt been almost successful, and the hunt so hot, that the faithful have wandered in solitude, and their solemn congregations have been, under such circumstances, few and far between. What sighs and cries have in such times gone up to the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth. How happy are we that we can meet for worship in any place we choose, and none dare molest us.</p>

No Urim and Thummim blazed on the High Priest&#39;s bosom, and no Shekinah shone from between the cherubim. The smoke of sacrifice and cloud of incense no more arose from the holy hill; solemn feasts were suspended, and even circumcision, the covenant sign, was forbidden by the tyrant. We, too, as believers, know what it is to lose our evidences and grope in darkness; and too often do our churches also miss the tokens of the Redeemer&#39;s presence, and their lamps remain untrimmed. Sad plaint of a people under a cloud! <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;There </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>more </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>any </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>prophet.&quot; </span>Prophecy was suspended. No inspiring psalm or consoling promise fell from bard or seer. It is ill with the people of God when the voice of the preacher of the gospel fails, and B famine of the word of life falls on the people. God-sent ministers are as needful to the saints as their daily bread, and it is a great sorrow when a congregation is destitute of it faithful pastor. It is to be feared, that with all the ministers now existing, there is yet a dearth of men whose hearts and tongues are touched with the celestial fire. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Neither </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>any </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>among </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>knoweth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>how </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>long.&quot; </span>If some one could foretell an end, the evil might be borne with a degree of patience, but when none can see a termination, or foretell an escape, the misery has a hopeless appearance, and is overwhelming. Blessed be God, he has not left his church in these days to be so deplorably destitute of cheering words; let us pray that he never may. Contempt of the word is very common, and may well provoke the Lord to withdraw it from us: may his long-suffering endure the strain, and his mercy afford us still the word of life.</p>

He who wrought out our salvation of old will not, cannot desert us now. Each past miracle of grace assures us that he who has begun to deliver will continue to redeem us from all evil. His deeds of old were public and wrought in the teeth of his foes, they were no delusions or make-believes; and, therefore, in all our perils we look for true and manifest assistance, and we shall surely receive it.</p>

All the world is in a measure dark, and hence everywhere there are cruel enemies of the Lord&#39;s people; but in some places a sevenfold night of superstition and unbelief has settled down, and there rage against the saints reaches to madness. Has not the Lord declared that the whole earth shall be filled with his glory I How can this be if he always permits cruelty to riot in dark places?

But still, though there be expostulation, there is no complaint; though there be mourning, there is no murmuring; there is far more the cry of a smitten child, wondering why, and grieving that his father&#39;s face is so turned away from him in displeasure, and a father&#39;s hand so heavy on the child of his love. Or, as we might almost say, it is like the cry of one of those martyred ones beneath the altar, wondering at the Lord&#39;s continued endurance of his heritage thus trampled under foot of the marauder and oppressor, and exclaiming, &quot;How long, O Lord, how long?&quot; And yet it is the appeal of one who was still a sufferer, still groaning under the pressure of his calamities, &quot; Why hast thou cast us off for ever? <span style='font-style:italic;'>We </span>see not <span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span>signs, there is no more any prophet among <span style='font-style:italic;'>us.<sup>,</sup>&#39;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Barton </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bouchier. </span></p>

Thirdly, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>length </span>of this affliction: it was so long that God did seem to cast them off <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>2. <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nearness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>her </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>relation: </span>&quot;Against <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sheep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pasture;<sup>&quot;</sup> </span>as if they should have said. Lord, if thou hadst done this against thine enemies, it had been no wonder; if thou hadst poured out thy wrath against the vessels of wrath, it had not been so much. But what! wilt thou draw out thy sword against <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sheep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pasture</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>? </span>It were no wonder that thou shouldst take the fat and the strong, and pour out thy judgments upon them; but wilt thou do it to <span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sheep</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>? </span>There be several doctrines that I may raise from these words; as, First doctrine: That God&#39;s people are his sheep. Second doctrine : That God may be sorely angry with his own people, with his own sheep. Third doctrine: That when God is angry with his people, it becomes them carefully to enquire into the cause. Fourth doctrine : That when God&#39;s people are under afflictions, they ought to take notice of, and be much affected with, his anger, from which they do proceed. Fifth doctrine : That God&#39;s people under afflictions are, or should be, more affected with his anger than with their smart. This is that which the church doth complain of, not that the church did so smart, but that God was displeased and angry; that did most affect them. Sixth doctrine: That God&#39;s people are apt to have misgiving thoughts of God when they are in sore afflictions, God was angry with his people, and their hearts did misgive them, as if God did cast off his people. Seventh doctrine: That God may be angry with his people, so sore, and so long, that in the judgment of sense it may seem that they are for ever cast off. Eighth doctrine : That though the people of God may not murmur against his proceedings, yet they may humbly expostulate with him about the cause.&#8212;<i>Joseph </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>Alleine. </span>1633&#8212;1668.</p>

and of the learned in general, that the institution of synagogues for worship originated in the reading of the law publicly after the collection of its volumes by Ezra, and that, consequently, there were no such places of solemn assembly previous to the Babylonish captivity. Some of the Jews themselves have expressed a conviction that this is the fact, and the Scriptures give no intimation of their existence antecedently to that time. We are aware, however, that one of the first Hebraists of the present day, the Rev. Dr. M&#39;Caul, inclines to the opinion of an earlier origin than that generally adopted. We quote his words: &quot;The existence of such places before the Babylonish captivity has been much disputed; and most writers, arguing from the silence of the Old Testament, incline to the opinion that they originated in Babylon, and that after the restoration similar oratories were opened in the land of Israel; and hence some infer that the Seventy-fourth Psalm, which says in the eighth verse, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span>hams <span style='font-style:italic;'>burned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>synagogues </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>land,&quot; </span>was written in the post-Babylonian times. The argument from silence is, however, far from conclusive. The translation of TJj)0 as <span style='font-style:italic;'>synagogue&#187;, </span>in the verse just cited, might fail ly lead to a similar translation in some other passages which were confessedly written before the captivity; and the circumstances, character, and necessities of the Israelites, the great body of whom were far removed from the temple, prove indisputably that in their towns and villages they must have had some locality where they assembled on their sabbaths, new moons, and other solemn days, for the purpose of receiving instruction in the law, and for public prayer. That locality, however different from subsequent arrangements, was the origin of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>synagogue. </span>How such assemblies were conducted before the captivity it is now impossible to say.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>F. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>A. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cox. </span></span></p>

But how rare the book of the law was through all Judaea, before the Babylonish captivity, many texts of Scripture tell us. When Jehoshaphat sent teachers through all Judea, to instruct the people in the law of God, they carried a book of the law with them (2 Chron. xvii. 9), which they needed not have done if there had been any copies of the law in those cities to which they went ; which certainly there would have been had there been any synagogues in them. And when Hilkiah found the law in the temple (2 Kings xxii. 8), neither he nor king Josiah needed to have been so surprised at it, had books of the law been common in those times. Their behaviour on that occasion sufficiently proves they had never seen it before, which could not be the case had there then been any other copies of it to be found among the people; and if there were no copies of the law at that time among them, there could then be most certainly no <span style='font-style:italic;'>synagogues </span>for them to resort to for the hearing of it read unto them.

It is during the exile, whilst the temple-worship was in abeyance, that we find indubitable proof of the systematic meetings on fasts for devotion and instruction (Zech. vii. 3&#8212;5 ; viii. 19). Religious meetings were also held on Sabbaths and fasts, to instruct the exiles in the divine law, and to admonish them to obey the divine precepts, (Ezra x. 1&#8212;9; Neh. viii. 1&#8212;3; ix. 1&#8212;3; xiii. 1&#8212;3).

The Zum, or people inhabiting the wilderness, are supposed, by many sensible writers, to be the Ichthyophagi, or fish-eaters, who occupied, according to ancient authors, a part of the coast of the Red Sea. The psalmist is here speaking of Israel&#39;s passage through its waters; and it is a singular fact that Diodorus, who lived about two thousand years ago, mentions a tradition, prevalent amongst these very persons, to the effect that in the time of their remote forefathers an extraordinai y reflux took place, the channel of the gulf becoming dry, and the green bottom appearing, whilst the whole body of water rolled away in an opposite direction. There can be little doubt that this strange people would have used for food, and various purposes, such great fish as might have been cast ashore on the termination of the miracle. Most writers give this text a figurative meaning, but that is no reason why it may not be also literally understood ; for such a mode of speaking is common in the Bible. But whether we understand it one way or the other, we have the testimony of heathens to its propriety and force. If, by the term <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Leviathan,&quot; </span>we believe Egypt to be intended, and by its &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>heads&quot;&#39; </span>those petty states into which that country was divided, the traditions of India, and the East, inform us that such designations were well understood, and therefore beautifully applicable.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Anon., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Biblical </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Theological </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gleanings; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0&#39;Neill.&quot; </span>1854.</p>

The discovery that &quot;no substance can be exposed to the sun&#39;s rays without undergoing a chemical change,&quot; has been described as scarcclv less important in its effects than the discovery of the law of gravitation. A sunbeam is one of the most powerful of all the agencies of nature; magical as it is, it breaks up the strongest chemical affinities; it is the author of colour, and is the creator of a myriad combinations, which all tend to the harmony of the world. Nor ought we to forget the moral influence of light. We are all aware of the sensible difference produced in our moral natures by a fine day or a dark day. Light gives zest and tone to the spirits; light gives buoyancy and joy to the soul ; light crowds the chambers of the mind with ideas; Light is <span style='font-style:italic;'>Life</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>the merest insect could not live without light; and even blind natures receive, in those organs which are not the property of vision, the assurance of its benignant operations. Light is <i>Order </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>and at its wand and command the separation takes place, and dark and light pair off into their separate ranks. Light is <span style='font-style:italic;'>Beauty</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>whether in the refulgence of the moon; the chill sparkle of the stars; the unrivalled play of colours in the attenuated film of the soap-bubble, at once the toy of childhood and the tool of the sage; the rich play of tints in the mother-of-pearl, or the rich gorgeous rays in the plumes of birds. Light is <span style='font-style:italic;'>Purity</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>forms that rankle out of the glance of its clear, steady beam, contract around themselves loathsomeness and disgust, and become the seats of foulness and shame. Light is <span style='font-style:italic;'>Growth: </span>where it is, we know that nature pursues her work in life and in vigour; light gives vitality to the sap; light removes obstructions from the pathway of the growing agencies, while, in its absence, forms become stunted, gnarled, and impaired. Light is <span style='font-style:italic;'>Health: </span>as it darts its clear and brilliant points to aud fro, it brings in its train those blessings cf elasticity and energy, which give the fulness of being&#8212;which is perfect health to the expanding forms. There is a flue consistency, when Scripture makes light to contain, as it were, the seeds of all things, and when the prelude of all creation is made to be those words, &quot;God said, Let there be light.&quot;</p>

What a long series of creations elapsed before moral causes seemed to operate in the affairs of the globe! But he, whose nature and whose name are Light, had given to light its distinct being and work; and that creative word, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>light,&#39;&quot; </span>spoke right forwards to the moral energies which were to be superinduced by its creation. Thus light, it is true, went before all things, and became the cause of moral consequences; but then, this arose from the divine hand, whence darted its benevolent beams. <span style='font-style:italic;'>It </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>who gave it its divine commission, to divide between light and darkness; <span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>who made it the fountain of knowledge and of day; <span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>who gave to it the faculty to become, in turn, a creator, and to warm into life and beauty a myriad seeds and shapes of loveliness.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>E. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Paxton </span><i>Hood. </i></p>

But not choosing, on such important point, to attach my faith to any general assertion, I sought to find out if any investigator of the nature of hght had perceived any distinction in its qualities or operation, which made it a fluid or matter independent of the sun. It was not easy, before the year 1791, to meet with the<a id='GBS.PA383.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.398.1.0.box.128.294.1298.632.q.60'>
works of any student of nature on such a subject, as it had been little attended to; but I at length saw the fact asserted by Henckel, a German of the old school, of some value in his day, and soon afterwards some experiments were announced in England which confirmed the supposition. It has been a favourite point of attention with me ever since; and no truth in philosophy seems to be now more clearly ascertained than that light has a distinct existence, separate and independent of the sun. This is it striking confirmation of the Mosaic record; for that expressly distinguishes the existence and operation of light from the solar action upon it, and from that radiation of it which is connected with his beams and presence. By Moses, an interval of three days is placed between the luminous creation, and the appearance and position of the sun and moon. Light was, therefore, operating by its own laws and agencies, without the sun, and independently of his peculiar agency, from the first day to the fourth of our terrestrial fabrication. But from the time that the sun was placed in his central position, and his rays were appointed to act on our earth, they have been always performing most beneficial operations, essential to the general course of things.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Sharon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Turner </span>(1768&#8212;1847), <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sacred </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>History </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>World.&quot; </span></span></p>

The dependence of human progress upon the existing configuration of the globe necessarily leads us to the conclusion that both must be the harmonious work of the same Almighty Power, and that a divine and immutable plan has from all eternity presided over the destinies of our planet. It is almost superfluous to point out how largely the irregular windings and undulations of the coasts, the numerous islands scattered over the face of the waters, the promontories stretching far away into the domains of the sea, and the gulfs plunging deeply into the bosom of the land, have contributed to the civilisation of the human race by multiplying its points of contact with the ocean, the great highway of nations. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>G. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hartu-ig, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Harmonies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Nature.&quot; </span>1866.</p>

It is known to be globular, and in shape nearly like an orange. And why has God chosen that form? With a view that it might be inhabited by living creatures on its whole surface. In order to this, every part of the globe must have sufficient light and heat, the wind must have a free circulation, and the water must be diffused over all its parts. The rotundity of the earth is best calculated to promote these conveniences: for this round form admits light and heat, without which there could be no life all over the globe. The revolutions of day and night, the changes in the temperature of the air, heat, cold, dryness or moisture, could not have taken place without this form. Had the earth been square, had it been conic, had it been an hexagon, or any other angular form, what must the consequence have been? The greatest part of our earth would have been drowned, whilst the rest would have languished with drought. Some couutries must have been torn in pieces by storms, while others would have been deprived of the wholesome circulation of wind. I have new reason to admire the supreme wisdom, when I reflect on the enormous mass which composes our world.

out of its bosom. There are regular and distinct strata found in the earth; some of stone, others of metal and minerals. There are numerous and evident advantages which result from these in favour of mankind. Do not the strata of gravel, sunk deep in the earth, purify and in a manner filter the water, and render it sweet and fit for use? On the surface of the earth there is a varied prospect; there is an admirable mixture of plains and valleys, of small hills and mountains. The man must be blind indeed that does nut see the wise purpose of the Great Author of nature, in thus diversifying the surface of the earth. Were the earth an even plain, how much beauty would it lose? Besides, this variety of valley and mountain is very favourable to the health of living creatures, and were there no hills, the earth would be less peopled with men and animals. There would be fewer plants, fewer samples and trees. We should be deprived of metals and minerals: the vapours would not be condensed, nor should we have either springs or rivers. Must we not then acknowledge that the whole plan of the earth, its form, its inward and outward construction, are all regulated according to the wisest laws, which all combine towards the pleasure and happiness of mankind? O thou supreme Author of nature, thou hast done all things well! Whichever way I turn my eyes, whether I penetrate into the interior structure of the globe thou hast appointed me to inhabit, or whether I examine its surface, I everywhere discover marks of profound wisdom and infinite goodness.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Christopher </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christian </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sturm. </span></span></p>

But even this test, which nature enjoys in winter, is a secret activity. A new creation is preparing in silence. The necessary dispositions are already making, that the desolate earth may again recover the children she has lost. The corn which is to serve us for food, already shoots. The fibres of plants, which are to adorn our fields and gardens, begin insensibly to open. 0 my beneficent Creator! Here I find fresh cause to adore thy wisdom and power. The repose which nature takes is as worthy to enter into the plan of thy wise providence, as the activity she shows in spring and summer. Thou hast wisely combined the several revolutions of the earth, thou hast equally divided its rest and labour. It is thy will that each day should vary the scenes of nature, in that way which is most proper for the perfection of the whole. Pardon, O God, my temerity, if I have been so stupid as to blame anything in the government of the world. I am more than ever convinced that all the plans of thy providence, though they may appear extraordinary to my weak reason, are replete with wisdom and goodness.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Christopher </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christian </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sturm. </span>1750&#8212;1786.</p>
