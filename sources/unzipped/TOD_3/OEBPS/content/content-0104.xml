How could he have fellowship with idols <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>What concord hath Christ with Belial? Sin is in itself so offensive that it makes the sinner offensive too. Idols of any sort are highly abhorrent to God, and we must see to it that we keep ourselves from them through divine grace, for rest assured idolatry is not consistent with true grace in the heart. If Dagon sit aloft in any soul, the ark of God is not there. Where the Lord dwells no image of jealousy will be tolerated. A visible church will soon become a visible curse if idols be set up in it, and then the pruning knife will remove it as a dead branch from the vine.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA449.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.464.1.1.box.170.718.1293.214.q.60'>Note that God did not utterly cast away his people Israel even when he greatly abhorred them, for he returned in mercy to them, so the subsequent verses tell us: so now the seed of Abraham, though for awhile under a heavy cloud, will be gathered yet again, for the covenant of salt shall not be broken. As for the spiritual seed, the Lord hath not despised nor abhorred them; they are his peculiar treasure and lie for ever near his heart.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA449.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.464.1.2.box.166.931.1297.568.q.60'>60. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;So </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forsook </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tabernacle </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Shiloh, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>placed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>among </span><i>men.&quot; </i>His glory would no more reveal itself there, he left Shiloh to become a complete ruin. At the door of that tent shameless sin had been perpetrated, and all around it idols had been adored, and therefore the glory departed, and Ichabod was sounded as a word of dread concerning Shiloh and the tribe of Ephraim. Thus may the candlestick be removed though the candle is not quenched. Erring churches become apostate, but a true church still remains; if Shiloh be profaned Zion is consecrated. Yet is it ever a solemn caution to all the assemblies of the saints, admonishing them to walk humbly with their God, when we read such words as those of the prophet Jeremiah in his seventh chapter, &quot;Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these. Go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.&quot; Let us take heed, lest as the ark never returned to Shiloh after its capture by the Philistines, so the gospel may be taken from us in judgment, never to be restored to the same church again.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA449.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.464.1.3.box.163.1499.1294.601.q.60'>61. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>delivered </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>captivity.&#39;&#39; </span>The ark was captured by the Philistines in battle, only because the Lord for the punishment of Israel chose to deliver it into their hands, otherwise they could have had no power at all against it. The token of the divine presence is here poetically called &quot;his strength;&quot; and, indeed, the presence of the Lord is his strength among his people. It was a black day when the mercy-seat was removed, when the cherubim took flight, and Israel&#39;s palladium was carried away. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And,</span><i>His </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemy&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand.&quot; </span>The ark was the place for the revealed glory of God, and his enemies exulted greatly when they bore it away into their own cities. Nothing could more clearly have shewn the divine displeasure. It seemed to say that Jehovah would sooner dwell among his avowed adversaries than among so false a people as Israel ; he would sooner bear the insults of Philistia than the treacheries of Ephraim. This was a fearful downfall for the favoured nation, and it was followed by dire judgments of most appalling nature. When God is gone all is gone. No calamity can equal the withdrawal of the divine presence from a people. O Israel, how art thou brought low! Who shall help thee now that thy God has li ft thee!</p>

Where the love is most fervent, the jealousy is most cruel, Sin cannot be tolerated in those who are a people near unto God.</p>

Thus Israel was brought very low, she could not find husbands for her maids, and therefore her state was not replenished; no young children clustered around parental knees. The nation had failed in its solemn task of instructing the young in the fear of Jehovah, and it was a fitting judgment that the very production of a posterity should be endangered.</p>

As the maidens had no heart for the marriage song, so the widows had no spirit, even to utter the funeral wail. The dead were buried too often and too hurriedly to allow of the usual rites of lamentation. This was the lowest depth; from this point things will take a gracious turn.</p>

It is wonderful how often divine wisdom so arranges the early and obscure portion of a choice life, so as to make it a preparatory school for a more active and noble future.</p>

Under David, the Jewish kingdom first rose to an honourable position among the nations, and exercised an influence over its neighbours. In closing the Psalm which has described the varying conditions of the chosen nation, we are glad to end so peacefully; with all noise of tumult or of sinful rites hushed into silence. After a long voyage over a stormy sea, the ark of the Jewish state rested on its Ararat, beneath a wise and gentle reign, to be waited no more hither and thither by floods and gales. The psalmist had all along intended to make this his last stanza, and we too may be content to finish all our songs of love with the reign of the Lord&#39;s anointed. Only we may eagerly enquire, when will it come? When shall we end these desert roamings, these rebellions, and chastisings, and enter into the rest of a settled kingdom, with the Lord Jesus reigning as &quot; the Prince of the house of David?&quot;</p>

For the higher every one rises in dignity, the less he considers it becoming to him to speak to the people, to teach and instruct them by word of mouth. They think they owe nothing to the people, but are altogether taken up with this, that they may be looked up to as princes, and so retain a certain secular majesty of command. But, with one&#39;s own mouth to teach the ignorant, is a singular proof of love and paternal affection, such as becomes the preceptor, pastor and teacher. This Christ most constantly employed, because he was touched with paternal affection towards the lost sheep, and came as a shepherd to seek them. The manner of earthly princes he therefore rejected, and clothed himself with that paternal custom which becomes the shepherd and teacher, going about and opening his mouth in order to give instruction. See Matthew v.

And Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren came to comfort him.&quot; The manner of the relation shows that the slaughter must have been great; and this flight and defeat, and their not acknowledging their dependence upon God, it is supposed the psalmist has in view in this place. But the objection to this interpretation is, that the event referred to in the book of Chronicles, evidently occurred at a time anterior to that of the Israelitish exodus from Egypt; whilst the 11th verse of this Psalm speaks of these same Ephrnimites being forgetful of God&#39;s doings and wonderful works which he did at the time of their exit from Egypt. It is, therefore, more probable that D&#39;&quot;\3K may designate the Israelitish people generally, which Mendelssohn thinks to be the case. He observes that &quot;the meaning of the noun Ephraim was that of a general term for Israel before the reigning of the house of David, because that Joshua the son of Nun, the first judge, was of this tribe; also because the territory assigned to this tribe was in the region of Shiloh : and it is possible that because of the reputation of this tribe in those days, all those who were in high esteem were also called Ephraimites.&quot; He might have added another and stronger reason than any of the preceding for this application of the term to Israel, and it is, that Jeroboam, who may be regarded as the founder of the Israelitish monarchy, is said, in 1 Kings xi. 26, to have been a descendant of Ephraim. The war alluded to may have been one of those which were waged between the ten tribes and the people of Judah.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Phillips. </span></p>

Against this God they had added sin to sin. Simply to sin is human, and happens to the saints, even after they have received grace: but to sin against God argues a singular degree of impiety. To sin against God is to injure and dishonour him in things immediately pertaining to himself. So they sinned against God, because after so many distinguished proofs and testimonies of his care made manifest to them, they continued to think and speak evil against him. &#39;All sins indeed, of whatever class they may be, are done against God, because they are opposed to his will; but those which are committed peculiarly against God, are certainly greater than others. Such are those wrought against his name, goodness, providence, power, truth, and worship, and against those things which specially concern him, whatever they may be. So we read of the sins of the sons of Eli, 1 Sam. ii. 24, 25: &quot;It is no good report that I hear: ye make the Lord&#39;s people to transgress. If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him to &#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Musculus. </span></p>

If you reflect a little, you can hardly fail to perceive, that in a very strict sense, this and the like may be said to be a tempting of God. Suppose a man to be discontented with the appointments of Providence; suppose him to murmur and repine at what the Almighty allots him to do or to bear: is he not to be charged with provoking God to change his purposes? and what is this if it be not &quot;tempting&quot; God&#8212;a striving to induce him to swerve from his plans, though every one of those plans has been settled by infinite wisdom? or, again, if any one of us, notwithstanding multiplied proofs of the Divine loving-kindness, doubt or question whether God do indeed love him ; of what is he guilty, if not of tempting the Lord, seeing that he solicits God to give additional evidence, as though there were deficiency, and challenges him to fresh demonstrations of what he has already abundantly displayed? This would be called &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>tempting&quot; </span>amongst men. If a child were to show by his actions that he doubted or disbelieved the affection of his parents, he would be considered as thereby striving to extort from them fresh proofs of that affection, though they had already done as much as either in justice or in wisdom they ought to have done; this would be a clear tempting of them, and that too in the ordinary sense of the term. In short, unbelief of every kind and degree may be said to be a tempting of God; for not to believe on the evidence which he has seen fit to give, is to tempt him to give more than he has already given &#8212;offering our possible assent, if proof were increased, as an inducement to him to go beyond what his wisdom has prescribed. . . . You cannot distrust God, and not accuse him of a want either of power or of goodness; you cannot repine,&#8212;no, not even in thought&#8212;without virtually telling him that his plans are not the best, nor his dispensations the wisest, which might have been appointed in respect of yourselves. So that your fear, or your despondency, or your anxiety in circumstances of perplexity, or of peril, is nothing less than a call upon God to depart from his fixed course,&#8212;a suspicion, or rather an assertion, that he might proceed in a manner more worthy of himself, and therefore a challenge to him to alter his dealings, if he would prove that he possesses the attributes which he claims. You may not intend thus to accuse, or provoke God, whenever you murmur ; but your murmuring does all this, and cannot fail to do it. You cannot be dissatisfied, without virtually saying that God might order things better; you cannot say that he might order things better, without virtually demanding that he change his course of acting, and give other proofs of his infinite perfections. And thus you <span style='font-style:italic;'>tempt </span>him, tempt him even as did the Israelites in the wilderness.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mehnll. </span></p>

It was no sin to be hungry and thirsty ; it was a necessity of their nature. There is nothing living that does not desire and require food: when we do not we are dead, and that they did so was no sin.

It is just the same with the Christian now. These Israelites did not more literally require a supply of daily food for their bodies, than does the Christian for his soul. Not to do so is a sign of death, and the living soul would soon die without it. And so far from its being a sin, our Lord has pronounced that man blessed who hungers and thirsts after righteousness, adding the most precious promise, that all such shall be satisfied. But it is a sin, and very great sin, should this food not be perceptibly, and to the evidence of our senses, immediately supplied, to murmur and be fearful.

He is the most thankful man that treasures up the mercies of God in his memory, and can feed his faith with what God hath done for him, so as to walk in the strength thereof in present straits.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

Now Niebuhr happily enables us to meet this just expectation, by his copies of the hieroglyphics on three of those tombstones, published in the XLVth and XLVIth plates of his first volume, and prefaced plate XLIV. by <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>plan </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cemetery </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>itself, </span>which is of more value than any or all subsequent descriptions. It was discovered by the present writer (as stated in a former work, [&quot; The Voice of Israel &quot;] on the evidence of no less than four Sinaitic inscriptions, that the birds of the miracle, named by Moses, generically, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;hv, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salu, </span>and by the psalmist, still more generally, &#39;N&#39;, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>winged </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fowls,&#39;&#39; </span>or more correctly &quot;long-winged fowls,&quot; were not (as rendered by all our versions, ancient and modern) <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;quails,&quot; </span>but a crane-like red bird resembling a goose, named in the Arabic <span style='font-style:italic;'>nuham. </span>The discovery received subsequently a singular and signal corroboration from the further discovery, by Dean Stanley, and previously by Schubert, of immense flocks of these very nuhams on the reputed scene of the miracle at Kibroth-Hattaavah. With these antecedents in his mind, the reader will now turn to the three monuments copied by Niebuhr in the cemetery of Sarbut-el-Khadem. He will at once see that a crane-like bird resembling a goose, with slender body and long legs, is the leading hieroglyphic symbol in all the three tablets. No fewer than twentyfive of these symbolic birds occur in the first, ten in the second, and fifteen in the third tablet. The goose appears occasionally, but the principal specimens have the air of the goose, but the form of the crane. In a word, they are the very species of birds seen by Dean Stanley, both at this point of Sinai, and at the first cataract of the Nile; and which constantly occur also in Egyptian monuments : as though the very food of Egypt, after which the Israelites lusted, was sent to be at once their prey and their plague. &quot;And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, <span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sat </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flesh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pots.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>Exod. xvi. 3.</p>

The unholy wretch sucks dregs and all, dregs of sin and dregs of wrath, whereas the Christian&#39;s cup is not thus spiced. <span style='font-style:italic;'>First, </span>dregs of sin ; the more he hath of the creature&#39;s delights given him, the more he sins with them. Oh, it is sad to think what work they make in his naughty heart! they are but fuel for his lusts to kindle upon ; away they run with their enjoyments, as the prodigal with his bags, or like hogs in shaking time; no sight is to be had of them, or thought of their return as long as they can get anything abroad, among the delights of the world. None so prodigiously wicked as those who are fed high with carnal pleasures. They are to the ungodly as the dung and ordure is to the swine which grows fat by lying in it; so their hearts grow gross and fat; their consciences more stupid and senseless in sin by them ; whereas the comforts and delights that God j&gt;ives unto a holy soul by the creature, turn to spiritual nourishment to his graces, and draw these forth into exercise, as they do others&#39; lusts. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Secondly, </span>dregs of wrath. The Israelites had little pleasure from their dainties, when the wrath of God fell upon them, before they could get them down their throats. The sinner&#39;s feast is no sooner served in but divine justice is preparing to send up a reckoning after it, and the fearful expectation of this cannot but spoil the taste of the other. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

That history of bringing through the Red Sea had this prophecy in it&#8212;that they should be brought safe to Canaan; but they did not believe the voice of this prophecy. When God gave them water out of the rock, this work promised that he would give them meat out of the clouds, if they needed it; but this they believed not. Hence the same Psalm reports their unbelief, under this notion (ver. 19, 20). &quot;They spake against God ; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

Is not man at his best estate altogether vanity? Yes, but here was a special vanity, and somewhat more penal and judicial lay upon that generation for their unbelief, than lies upon mankind as the fruit of sin in general. And what was that? Even the evil threatened in the text [Isa. vii. 9, latter part] : they could not be established. God lets them wander forty years in a wilderness, up and down, forward and backward; now in hope, anon in fear; now in joy, anon in sorrow; now in success, by-and-by in disappointment.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl. </span></p>
