Stephen looked up to heaven (Acts vii. 55). He sent a post; a greedy, pitiful, and hungry look up to Christ, out at the window, at the nearest passage, to tell that a poor friend was coming up to him. Second. I would wish no more, if I were in hell, but to send up a look to heaven. There be many lovelooks of the saints, lying up before the throne, in the bosom of Christ.

There was glory taken from God. Not his essential glory, nor any perfection of his being, for that cannot be taken away; but that glory which shines forth in the moral government of his creatures, and that glory which we are bound to give him. 2. There was righteousness, holiness, and happiness taken from man also. (1) There was a loss of righteousness to the guilty sinner; (2) of holiness to the polluted sinner: (3) of happiness to the miserable sinner. II. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Wherein </span>it <span style='font-style:italic;'>appears </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christ </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>did </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><i>take </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>away </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>those </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>either. </span>1. It is plain, as to God, he never took away any glory from him; for he never did anything dishonourable or offensive to God. John viii. 29; Isaiah 1. 5; Luke i. 35. 2. It is also clear, as to man, that he took not away any righteousness, holiness, or happiness from him. He was not such a fountain of guilt, pollution, and misery, as the first Adam had been, but the contrary. 3. The Scripture, therefore, speaks of Christ&#39;s being cut off, but not for himself, Dan. ix. 26; 1 Pet. iii. 18; Isa. liii. 4, 5. 4. The innocency of Christ was conspicuous in his very sufferings. Though they found no cause of death in him. yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. Acts xiii. 28. III. <span style='font-style:italic;'>How </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>did </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christ </span><i>restore </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>those </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>took </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>away? </span>In general, by his active and passive obedience. 1. Christ&#39;s doing the will of God in such a manner as he did it, was a greater honour to God than ever had been, or could be done before. 2. Christ&#39;s suffering of the will of God, made a considerable addition to the glory of God, which had been impaired by the sin of man, Heb. v. 8 ; John svii. 4; and xiii. 31. 3. Christ hath provided for the justification of the sinner by the obedience which he fulfilled, Rom. v. 8. 4. Christ communicates that grace which is necessary for our sanctification also. 5. Christ hath merited for us a present blessedness in this world. 6. Jesus Christ hath procured for us a more full and absolute blessedness in the world to come.

It was a necessary work, a work which must be done, in order to his being a Saviour. 2. It was a work impossible for any mere creature to do; so that if Christ did not, it could not be done by any person besides him.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Timothy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cruso&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon. </span></p>

According to the law, if a man stole and killed, or sold an ox, he was to restore five oxen; or a sheep, he was to restore four; and if the ox or sheep was found alive, he was to restore two. Hence, to oblige a man to restore when he had taken nothing, was the greatest injustice. Eiod.<a id='GBS.PA275.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.290.1.0.box.121.299.1305.177.q.50'>
xxii. 1&#8212;5.

But what was it Christ restored? Nay, all that was lost. Adam by sin had done all that he could to take away God&#39;s glory, and with it his own glory and happiness. He had robbed God of his glory, God&#39;s law of its due, himself of God&#39;s image, and of God&#39;s favour. Sin had brought in death, spiritual and eternal; and he and all his descendants stood tremblingly exposed to everlasting misery. All these and more Jesus restored. As man&#39;s Surety and man&#39;s Representative, and called to it by the authority of Jehovah, the Lord Christ restored to God his glory, and to man God&#39;s image of favour; and having destroyed sin, death, hell, and the grave, he restored to his redeemed a better paradise than our nature had lost!

Since this is the case, when they slip aside, or carry not aright; since they are all in hazard of doing so, it should be matter of affecting and afflicting exercise, lest they do so. Fellow professors are ashamed of the person that walketh not aright; they are ashamed that ever they should have been in company or fellowship with him ; they are ashamed that ever such a person should have owned such a cause, and that ever such a thing should have befallen a professor of such a cause; and, besides, they are weakened by him in their hopes of persevering for themselves. Again, they are in hazard of being a discredit to all the godly, because, say they, it seems the Lord has granted no peremptory promise, as to the manner of their final perseverance ; and corruption enough remains in them still, to overturn all their stock of grace, if they get not present renewed influences.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Guthrie. </span>1620-1655.</span></p>

There have been those who have rather chosen death, and have wiped off a dishonour with their blood. So Saul slew himself rather than he would fall into&#39;the hands of the Philistines, who would have insulted over him, and mocked him as they did Samson. So that king (Jer. xxxviii. 19) rather chose to lose his country, life, and all, than to be given to the Jews, his subjects, to be mocked of them. . . . Confusion of face is one of the greatest miseries that hell itself is set forth unto us by. There is nothing that a noble nature more abhors than shame, for honour is a spark of God&#39;s image; and the more of God&#39;s image there is in any one, the more is shame abhorred by him, which is the debasing of it, and so the greater and more noble any one&#39;s spirit, the more he avoids it. To a base, low spirit, indeed, shame is nothing; but to a great spirit (as to David), than to have his &quot; glory turned into shame,&quot; as Psalm iv. 2, is nothing more grievous. And the greater glory any loseth, the greater is his shame. What must it be then to Christ, who because he was to satisfy God in point of honour debased by man&#39;s sin, therefore of all punishments besides, he suffered most of shame; it being also (as was said) one of the greatest punishments in hell. And Christ, as he assumed other infirmities of our nature, that made him possible in - other things&#8212;as to be sensible of hunger, want of sleep, bodily torments, of unkindnesses, contempt, so likewise of disgrace and shame. He took that infirmity as well as fear ; and though he had a strength to bear and despise it (as the author to the Hebrews speaks), yet none was ever more sensible of it. As the delicacy of the temper of his body made him more sensible of pains than ever any man was, so the greatness of his spirit made him more apprehensive of the evil of shame than ever any was. So likewise the infinite love and candour of his spirit towards mankind made him take in with answerable grief the unkindnesses and injuries which they heaped upon him.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

The Sacred Oracles afford no countenance to the supposition that devotional feelings are to be condemned as visionary and enthusiastic merely on account of their intenseness and elevation; provided they be of the right kind, and spring from legitimate sources, they never teach us to suspect they can be carried too far.

Michal&#39;s scoffing at David did but inflame and raise his zeal: &quot;If this be to be vile, I will be more vile,&quot; 2 Sam. vi. 20&#8212;22. Look, as fire in the winter burns the hotter, by an <span style='font-style:italic;'>avrisepioraois, </span>because of the coldness of the air; so in the winter of affliction and persecution, that divine fire, the zeal of a Christian, burns so much the hotter, and flames forth so much the more vehemently and strongly. In times of greatest affliction and persecution for holiness&#39; sake, a Christian hath, first, a good captain to lead and encourage him; secondly, a righteous cause to prompt and embolden him; thirdly, a gracious God to relieve and succour him; fourthly, a glorious heaven to receive and reward him ; and, certainly, these things cannot but mightily raise him and inflame him under the greatest opposition and persecution. These things will keep him from fearing, fawning, fainting, sinking, or flying in a stormy day ; yea, these things will make his face like the face of an adamant, as God promised to make Ezekiel&#39;s. Ezekiel iii. 7&#8212;9, and Job xli. 24. Now an adamant is the hardest of stones, it is harder than a flint, yea, it is harder than the nether-millstone. The naturalists [Pliny] observe, that the hardness of this stone is unspeakable: the fire cannot burn it, nor so much as heat it through, nor the hammer cannot break it, nor the water cannot dissolve it, and, therefore, the Greeks call it an adamant from its untameableness; and in all storms the adamant shrinks not, it shrinks not it fears not, it changeth not its hue; let the times be what they will, the adamant is still the same. In times of persecution, a good cause, a good God, and a good conscience will make a Christian like an adamant, it will make him invincible and unchangeable. When one desired to know what kind of man Basil was, there was presented to him in a dream, saith the history, a pillar of fire with this motto, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Talis </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>est </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>liasilius, </span>Basil is such a one, he is all on a-light fire for God. Persecutions will but set a Christian all on a-light fire for God.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Brooks. </span></p>

and take it upon ourselves that we might rather be spit upon and contemned than Christ. It was a brave speech of Ambrose, &quot;he wished it would please God to turn all the adversaries from the church upon himself, and let them satisfy their thirst with his blood:&quot; this is a true Christian heart. And, therefore, if it be for our sakes, and we have anything in the business by which Christ is reproached, we should be willing rather to sacrifice ourselves, than that Christ should be reproached; and as Jonah, when he knew that the tempest rose for his sake, says he, &quot;Cast me into the sea and so Nazianzen, when contention rose about him, says he, &quot;Cast me into the sea, let me lose my place, rather than the name of Christ should suffer for me.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Jeremiah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Burroughs. </span></span></p>

The passion of our Lord was providentially so ordered as to furnish a remarkable coincidence with this verse. The Romans were accustomed to give sour wine, with an infusion of myrrh, to convicts on the cross, for the purpose of deadening the pain. This practice was adhered to in our Saviour&#39;s case (Mark xv. 23). Though in itself not cruel, but the contrary, it formed part of the great process of murderous persecution. On the part of the Roman soldiery it may have been an act of kindness; but, considered as an act of the unbelieving Jews, it was giving <span style='font-style:italic;'>gall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vinegar </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span>one already overwhelmed with anguish. And so Matthew, in accordance with his general method, represents it as a verification of this passage (Matt. xxvii. 34). He does not contradict Mark&#39;s account, before referred to, but merely intimates that the wine and myrrh thus offered were to be regarded as identical with the gall and vinegar of this prediction. And, in order to prevent the coincidence from being overlooked, our Lord, before he died, complained of thirst, and vinegar was administered.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Addison </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Alexander. </span></p>

The truth is, that none written in heaven can ever be lost; yet they object against it this verse. Hence, they infer, that some names once there recorded are afterwards put out; but this opinion casteth a double aspersion on God himself. Either it makes him ignorant of future things, as if he foresaw not the end of elect and reprobate, and so were deceived in decreeing some to be saved that shall not be saved; or, that his decree is mutable, in excluding those upon their sins whom he hath formerly chosen. From both these weaknesses St. Paul vindicates him (2 Tim. ii. ID): &quot;The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.&quot; First, &quot; The Lord knows them that are his;&quot; this were not true if God&#39;s prescience could be deluded.
