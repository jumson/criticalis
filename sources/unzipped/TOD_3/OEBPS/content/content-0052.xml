Or, it may mean, our praise is but silence compared with thy deservings, O God. Or, in solemn silence, we worship thee, because our praise cannot be uttered; accept, therefore, our silence as praise. Or, we are so engrossed in thy praise, that to all other things we are dumb; we have no tongue for anything but thee. Perhaps the poet best expressed the thought of the Psalmist when he said&#8212;</p>

A church, bowed into silent udoration by a profound sense of divine mercy, would certainly offer more real praise than the sweetest voices aided by pipes and strings; yet, vocal music is not to be neglected, for this sacred hymn was meant to be sung. It is well before singing to have the soul placed in a waiting attitude, and to be humbly conscious that our best praise is but silence compared with Jehovah&#39;s glory.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA161.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.176.1.3.box.78.872.1280.497.q.60'><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>performed.&#39;&#39; </span>Perhaps a special vow made during a season of drought and political danger. Nations and churches must be honest and prompt in redeeming their promises to the Lord, who cannot be mocked with impunity. So, too, must individuals. We are not to forget our vows, or to redeem them to be seen of men&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>alone must they be performed, with a single eye to his acceptance. Believers are all under covenant, which they made at conversion, and have renewed upon being baptised, joining the church, and coming to the table, and some of them are under special pledges which they entered into under peculiar circumstances; these are to be piously and punctually fulfilled. We ought to be very deliberate in promising, and very punctilious in performing. A vow unkept will burn the conscience like a hot iron. Vows of service, of donation, of praise, or whatever they may be, are no trifles: and in the day of grateful praise they should, without fail, be fulfilled to the utmost of our power.</p>

What a delightful tide for the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Every right and sincere prayer is as surely heard as it is offered. Here the psalmist brings in the personal pronoun <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;thou,&quot; </span>and we beg the reader to notice how often &quot;thou,&quot; &quot;thee,&quot; and &quot;thy,&quot; occur in this hymn; David evidently believed in a personal God, and did not adore a mere idea or abstraction. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flesh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come.&quot; </span>This shall encourage men of all nations to become suppliants to the one and only God, who proves his Deity by answering those who seek his face. Flesh they are, and therefore weak ; frail and sinful, they need to pray; and thou art such a God as they need, for thou art touched with compassion, and dost condescend to hear the cries of poor flesh and blood. Many come to thee now in humble faith, and are filled with good, but more shall be drawn to thee by the attractiveness of thy love, and at length the whole earth shall bow at thy feet. To come to God is the life of true religion,we come weeping in conversion, hoping in supplication, rejoicing in praise, and delighting in service. False gods must in due time lose their deluded votaries, for man when enlightened will not be longer befooled ; but each one who tries the true God is encouraged by his own success to persuade others also, and so the kingdom of God comes to men, and men come to it.</p>

Note the word &quot;our,&quot; the faith of the one penitent who speaks for himself in the first clause, here embraces all the faithful in Zion ; and he is so persuaded of the largeness of forgiving love that he leads all the saints to sing of the blessing. What a comfort that iniquities which prevail against us, do not prevail against God. They would keep us away from God, but he sweeps them away from before himself and us; they are too strong for us, but not for our Redeemer, who is mighty, yea, and almighty to save. It is worthy of note that as the priest washed in the laver before he sacrificed, so David leads us to obtain purification from sin before we enter upon the service of song. When we have washed our robes and made them white in his blood, then shall we acceptably sing, &quot; Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.&quot;</span></p>

But dwelling in the house we are treated as sons, for the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the son nbidcth ever.

answers it in a manner fitted to inspire awe in the hearts of his people. The saints, in the commencement of the Psalm, offered praise in reverential silence; and now, in the like awe-stricken spirit, they receive answers to their prayers. The direct allusion here is, no doubt, to the Lord&#39;s overthrow of the enemies of his people in ways calculated to strike terror into all beholders; his judgments in their severe righteousness were calculated to excite fear both among friends and foes. Who would not fear a God whose blows are so crushing? We do not always know what we are asking for when we pray; when the answer comes, the veritable answer, it is possible that we may be terrified by it. We seek sanctifieation, and trial will be the reply: we ask for more faith, and more affliction is the result: we pray for the spread of the gospel, and persecution scatters us. Nevertheless, it is good to ask on, for nothing which the Lord grants in his love can do us any harm. Terrible things will turn out to be blessed things after all, where they come in answer to prayer.</span></p>

Where but in Jesus could they be blended? The God who saves may answer our prayers in a way which puts unbelief into aflutter; but when faith spies the Saviour, she remembers that &quot;things are not what they seem,&quot; and she is of good courage. He who is terrible is also our refuge from terror when we see him in the Well-beloved. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>confi</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dence </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ends </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth.&quot; </span>The dwellers in the far-off isles trust in God; those most remote from Zion yet confide in the ever living Jehovah. Even those who dwell in countries, frozen or torrid, where nature puts on her varied terrors, and those who see dread wonders on the deep, yet fly from the terrors of God and place their confidence in the God of terrors.

If the land gave Moses elders, the sea gave Jesus apostles. Noah, when all was ocean, was as calm with God as Abraham in his tent. All men are equally dependent upon God: the-seafaring man is usually most conscious of this, but in reality he is not more so than the husbondman, nor the husbandman than anyone else. There is no room for selfconfidence on land or sea, since God is the only true confidence of men on earth or ocean. Faith is a plant of universal growth, it is a tree of life on shore and a plant of renown at sea; and, blessed be God, those who exercise faith in him anywhere shall find that he is swift and strong to answer their prayers.

The firmest owe their stability to him. Philosophers of the forget-God school are too much engrossed with their laws of upheaval to think of the Upheaver. Their theories of volcanic action and glacier action, lfec, &amp;c, are frequently used as bolts and bars to shut the Lord out of his own world. Our poet is of another mind, and sees God&#39;s hand settling Alps and Andes on their bases, and therefore he sings in his praise.

Canute had not a more perilous seat by the rising billows than many a king and emperor has had when the multitude have been set on mischief, and have grown weary of their lords. God alone is King of nations. The sea obeys him, and the yet more tumultuous nations are kept in check by him. Human society owes its preservation to the continued power of God: evil passions would secure its instant dissolution; envy, ambition, and cruelty would create anarchy to-morrow, if God did not prevent; whereof we have had clear proof in the various French revolutions. Glory be unto God who maintains the fabric of social order, and checks the wicked, who would fain overthrow all things. The child of God in seasons of trouble should fly at once to him who stills the seas: nothing is too hard for him.</span></p>

Zembla sees them as well as Zion, and Terra del Fuego as surely as the Terra Sacra. These tokens are sometimes terrible phenomena in nature&#8212;such as earthquakes, pestilence, tornado, or storm ; nnd when these are seen, even the most barbarous people tremble before God. At other times they are drend works of providence&#8212;such as the overthrow of Sodom, and the destruction of Pharaoh. The rumour of these judgments travels to earth&#39;s utmost verge, and impresses all people with a fear and trembling at such a just and holy God. We bless God that we are not afraid but rejoice at his tokens; with solemn awe we are glad when we behold his mighty acts.

Our rising hours are bright with hope, and our evening moments mellow with thanksgiving. Whether the sun go forth or come in we bless God and rejoice in the gates of the day. When the fair morning blushes with the rosy dawn we rejoice; and when the calm evening smiles restfully we rejoice still. We do not believe that the dew weeps the death of the day; we only see jewels bequeathed by the departing day for its successor to gather up from the earth. Faith, when she sees God, rounds the day with joy. She cannot fast, because the bridegroom is with her. Night and day are alike to her, for the same God made them and blessed them. She would have no rejoicing if God did not make her glad; but, blessed be his name, he never ceases to make joy for those who find their joy in him.</p>

The deluge poured from the clouds yesterday may be succeeded by another to-morrow, and yet the waters above the firmament shall not fail. How true is this in the realm of grace ; there &quot; the river of God is full of water,&quot; and &quot; of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.&quot; The ancients in their fables spake of Pactolus, which flowed over sands of gold ; but this river of God, which flows above and from which the rain is poured, is far more enriching; for, after all, the wealth of men lies mainly in the harvest of their fields, without which even gold would be of no value whatever. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preparesl </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>corn.&#39;&#39; </span>Corn is specially set apart to be the food of man. In its various species it is a divine provision for the nutriment of our race, and is truly called the staff of life. We hear in commerce of &quot;prepared corn-flour,&quot; but God prepared it long before man touched it. As surely as the manna was prepared of God for the tribes, so certainly is corn made and sent by God for our daily use. What is the difference whether we gather wheat-ears or manna, and what matters it if the first comes upward to us, and the second downward? God is as much present beneath as above; it is as great a marvel that food should rise out of the dust, as that it should fall from the skies. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>When </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><i>hast </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#187;o </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>provided </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it.&quot; </span>When all is prepared to produce corn, the Loid puts the finishing stroke, and the grain is forthcoming; not even, when all the material is prepared, will the wheat be perfected without the continuous and perfecting operation of the Most High. Blessed be the Great Householder; he does not suffer the harvest to fail, he supplies the teeming myriads of earth with bread enough from year to year. Even thus does he vouchsafe heavenly food to his redeemed ones: &quot;He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.&quot;</p>

Or, we may understand the expression to mean that God&#39;s love encircles the year as with a crown ; each month has its gems, each day its pearl.

Thus praise waits, or is silent for God ; it is silent to other things, and it waits to be employed about him. The soul is often put to a nonplus in crying up the grace of God, and wants words to express its greatness; yea, to answer the elevation of the thoughts; the heart indites a song of praise, but it cannot tune it. The psalmist is stopped, as it were, through admiration (which is <span style='font-style:italic;'>silentium </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>intellectus), </span>for when the mind can rise no higher, it falls admiring; hence some say, God is most exalted with fewest words.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Alexander </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Carmichael. </span></p>

But God&#39;s people need not lay it aside on that score. Our text bears two things with respect to that mutter. 1, A comfortable title ascribed to God. with the unanimous consent of all the sons of Zion, who are all praying persons: &quot;O <span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hearest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>prayer.&#39;&#39; </span>He speaks to&quot;6Vrf in <i>Zion,&quot; </i>or Zion&#39;s God, that is in New Testament language, to God in Christ. An absolute God thundereth on sinners from Sinai, there can be no comfortable intercourse betwixt God and them, by the law : but in Zion, from the mercy-seat, in Christ, he is the hearer of prayer; they give in their supplications, and he graciously hears them. Such faith of it they have, that praise waits there for the prayer-hearing God. 2. The effect of the savour of this title of God, spread abroad in the world: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flesh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come:&quot; </span>not only Jews, but Gentiles. The poor Gentiles who have long in vain implored the aid of their idols, hearing and believing that God is the hearer of prayer, will flock to him, and present their petitions. They will throng in about his door, where by the gospel they understand beggars are so well served. They will &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee,&quot; </span>Heb.

The supernatural instinct of praying that is found in all that are born of God, Gal. iv. 6. It is as natural for them to fall a praying when the grace of God has touched their hearts, as for children when they are born into the world to cry, or to desire the breasts. Zechariah xii. 10, compared with Acts ix. 11, where in the account that is given of Paul, at his conversion, it is particularly noticed, &quot;Behold he prayeth.&quot; Hence the whole saving change on a soul comes under the character of this instinct. Jeremiah iii. 4, 19. Secondly. The intercession of Christ, Rom. viii. 34. It is a great part of the work of Christ&#39;s intercession to present the prayers of his people before his Father, Rev. viii. 4, to take their causes in hand, contained in their supplications. 1 John ii. 1. Thirdly. The promises of the covenant, whereby God&#39;s faithfulness is impawned for the hearing of prayer, as Matt. vii. 7: tree &#187;lso Isaiah lxv. 24. Fourthly. The many encouragements given in the Word to the people of God, to come with their cases unto the Lord by prayer. He invites them to his throne of grace with their petitions for supply of their needs. Cant. ii. 14. He sends afflictions to press them to come. Hosea <sup>v</sup>- 15. He gives them ground of hope of success, Psalm I. 15, whatever extremity their case is brought to. . Isaiah xli. 17. He shows them that however long he may delay their trial, yet praying and not fainting shall be successful at length. Luke xviii. 8. Fifthly. The gracious nature of God, with the inter relations he stands in to his people. Exodus xxii. 27. He wants not power and ability to fulfil the holy desires of his people; he is gracious, and will withhold no good from them that they really need. He has the bowels of a father to pity them, the bowels of a mother to her sucking child. He has a most tender sympathy with them in all their afflictions, the touches on them are as on the apple of his eye; and he never refuses them a<a id='GBS.PA170.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.185.1.0.box.252.287.1273.213.q.60'>
request, but for their good. Rom. viii. 28. Sixthly. The experiences which the saints of all ages have had of the answer of prayer. The faith of it brings them to God at conversion, as the text intimates: and they that believe cannot be disappointed. Lastly. The present ease and relief that prayer sometimes gives to the saints, while yet the full answer of prayer is not come. Psalm exxxviii. 3.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Boston </span>(1676&#8212;1732).</span></p>

There are several interesting and instructive ideas connected with this view of it. All the other plants we use as food are unfit for this purpose in their natural condition, and require to have their nutritious qualities developed, and their natures and forms to a certain extent changed by a gradual process of cultivation. There is not a single useful plant, grown in our gardens and fields, but is utterly worthless for food in its normal or wild state; and man has been left to himself to find out, slowly and painfully, how to convert these crudities of nature into nutritious vegetables. But it is not so with corn. It has from the very beginning been an abnormal production. God gave it to Adam, we have every reason to believe, in the same perfect state of preparation for food in which we find it at the present day. It was made expressly for man, and given directly into his hands. &quot;Behold,&quot; says the Creator, &quot;I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth ;&quot; that is, all the<a id='GBS.PA176.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.191.1.0.box.230.294.1283.73.q.60'>

The primitive types from which all our other esculent plants were derived are still to be found in a state of nature in this or other countries. The wild beet and cabbage still grow on our sea-shores; the crab-applo and the slots, the savage parents of our luscious pippins and plums, are still found among the trees of the wood ; but where are the original types of our corn plants? Where are the wild grasses which, according to some authors, the cumulative processes of agriculture, carried on through successive ages, have developed into corn, wheat, and barley? Much has been written, and many experiments have been tried, to determine the natural origin of these cereals, but every effort has hitherto proved in vain. Reports have again and again been circulated that corn and wheat have been found growing wild in some parts of Persia and the steppes of Tartary, apparently far from the influence of cultivation ; but when tested by botanical data, these reports have turned out, in every instance, to be unfounded. Corn has never been known as anything else than a cultivated plant.</p>

It is never, like other plants, self-sown and self-diffused. Neglected of men, it speedily disappears and becomes extinct. It does not return, as do all other cultivated varieties of plants, to a natural condition, and so become worthless as food, but utterly perishes, being constitutionally unfitted to maintain the struggle for existence with the aboriginal vegetation of the soil. All this proves that it must have been produced miraculously; or, in other words, given by God to man directly, in the same abnormal condition in which it now appears; for nature never could have developed or preserved it. In the mythologies of all the ancient nations it was confidently affirmed to have had a supernatural origin. The Greeks and Romans believed it to be the gift of the goddess Ceres, who taught her soul, Triptolemus, to cultivate and distribute it over the earth; and from her, the whole class of plants received the name of cereals, which they now bear. And we only express the same truth when we say to him, whom these pagans ignorantly worshipped, <i>&quot;Thou </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>preparest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>corn, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>so </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>provided </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span>it.&quot;</p>

Corn is universally diffused. It is almost the only species of plant which is capable of growing everywhere, in almost every soil, in almost any situation. In some form or other, adapted to the various modifications of climate and physical conditions, which occur in different countries, it is spread over an area of the earth&#39;s surface as extensive as the occupancy of the human race</p>
<a id='GBS.PA176.w.1.4.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.191.1.4.box.236.1750.1287.604.q.60'>Rice is grown in tropical countries where periodical rains and inundations, followed by excessive heat, occur, and furnishes the chief article of diet for the largest proportion of the human race. Wheat will not thrive in hot climates, but flourishes all over the temperate zone, at various ranges of elevation, and is admirably adapted to the wants of highly civilised communities. Maize spreads over an immense geographical area in the new world, where it has been known from time immemorial, and formed a principal element of that Indian civilisation which surprised the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru. Barley is cultivated in those parts of Europe and Asia where the soil and climate are not adapted for wheat; while oats and rye extend far into the bleak north, and disappear only from those desolate Arctic regions where man cannot exist in his social capacity. By these striking adaptations of different varieties of grain, containing the same essential ingredients, to different soils and climates, Providence has furnished the indispensable food for the sustenance of the human race throughout the whole habitable globe; and all nations, and tribes, and tongues can rejoice together, as one great family, with the joy of harvest.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Hugh </span><i>Macmillan, </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><i>&quot;Bible </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>Teachings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Nature.</span>&quot; 1868.</p>
