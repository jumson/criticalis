Thus David had prayed, and here his Son and Lord utters the same cry. This is the second Psalm which begins with a &quot;Save me, O God,&quot; and the former (Ps. liv.) is but a short summary of this more lengthened complaint. It is remarkable that such ob scene of woe should be presented to us immediately after the jubilant ascension hymn of the last Psalm, but this only shows how<a id='GBS.PA259.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.274.1.0.box.99.318.1309.532.q.50'>
interwoven are the glories and the sorrows of our ever-blessed Redeemer. The head which now is crowned with glory is the same which wore the thorns; he to whom we pray, &quot;Save us, O God,&quot; is the selfsame person who cried, &quot;Save me, O God.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul.&quot; </span>Sorrows, deep, abounding, deadly, had penetrated his inner nature. Bodily anguish is not his first complaint; he begins not with the gall which embittered his lips, but with the mighty griefs which broke into his heart. All the sea outside a vessel is less to be feared than that which finds its way into the hold. A wounded spirit who can bear. Our Lord in* this verse is seen before us as a Jonah, crying, &quot;The waters compassed me about, even to the soul.&quot; He was doing business for us on the great waters, at his Father&#39;s command; the stormy wind was lifting up the waves thereof, and he went down to the depths till his soul was melted because of trouble. In all this he has sympathy with us, and is able to succour us when we, like Peter, beginning to sink, cry to him, &quot;Lord, save, or we perish.&quot;</span></p>

Here our Lord pictures the close, clinging nature of his heart&#39;s woes. &quot;He began to be sorrowful, and very heavy.&quot; Sin is as mire for its filthiness, and the holy soul of the Saviour must have loathed even that connection with it which was necessary for its expiation. His pure and sensitive nature seemed to sink in it, for it was not his element, he was not like us born and acclimatised to this great dismal swamp. Here our Redeemer became another Jeremiah, of whom it is recorded (Jer. xxxviii. 6) that his enemies cast him into a dungeon wherein &quot;was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.&quot; Let our hearts feel the emotions, both of contrition and gratitude, as we see in this simile the deep humiliation of our Lord. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>where </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>floods </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>overflow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&#39;&#39; </span>The sorrow gathers even greater force; he is as one cast into the sea, the waters go over his head. His sorrows were first within, then around, and now above y our Lord was no faint-hearted sentimentalist; his were real woes, and though he bore them heroically, yet were they terrible even to him. His sufferings were unlike all others in degree, the waters were such as soaked into the soul; the mire was the mire of the abyss itself, and the floods were deep and overflowing. To us the promise is, &quot;the rivers shall not overflow thee,&quot; but no such word of consolation was vouchsafed to him. My soul, thy Wellbeloved endured all this for thee. Many waters could not quench his love, neither could the floods drown it; and, because of this, thou hast the rich benefit of that covenant assurance, &quot; as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.&quot; He stemmed the torrent of almighty wrath, that we might for ever rest in Jehovah&#39;s love.</p>

Long pleading with awful fervour had scorched his throat as with flames of fire. Few, very few, of his saints follow their Lord in prayer so far as this. We are, it is to be feared, more likely to be hoarse with talking frivolities to men than by pleading with God; yet our sinful nature demands more prayer than his perfect humanity might seem to need. His prayers should shame us into fervour. Our Lord&#39;s supplications were salted with fire, they were hot with agony ; and hence they weakened his system, and made him &quot; a weary man and full of woes.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eyes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fail </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>while </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wait </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>He wanted in his direst distress nothing more than his God ; that would be all in all to him.

their pencils fail in every feature of his all but fair but all marred countenance, but most of all do they come short when they venture to pourtray those eyes which were fountains of tears. He knew how both to pray and to watch, and he would have us learn the like. There are times when we should pray till the throat is dry, and watch till the eyes grow dim. Only thus can we have fellowship with him in his sufferings. What! can we not watch with him one hour? Does the flesh shrinks backt o cruel flesh to be so tender of thyself, and so ungenerous to thy Lord!</span></p>

He neither blasphemed God, nor injured man. As Samuel said : &quot;Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed if&quot; Even so might Jesus enquire. Besides, he had not only done us no evil, but he had bestowed countless and priceless benefits. Well might he demand, &quot;For which of these works do ye stone me?&quot; Yet from his cradle to his cross, beginning with Herod and not ending with Judas, he had foes without number; and he justly said, they &quot;<i>are </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>more </span><i>than </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hairs </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>head.&quot; </span>Both the civilians and the military, laics and clerics, doctors and drunkards, princes and people, set themselves against the Lord&#39;s anointed. &quot;This is the heir, let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours,&quot; was the unanimous resolve of all the keepers of the Jewish vineyard ; while the Gentiles outside the walls of the garden furnished the instruments for his murder, and actually did the deed. The hosts of earth and hell, banded together, made up vast legions of antagonists, none of whom had any just ground for hating him. <i>&quot;They </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>would </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>destroy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>being </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wrongfully, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mighty.&quot; </span>It was bad that they were many, but worse that they were mighty. All the ecclesiastical and military powers of his country were arrayed against him. The might of the Sanhedrim, the mob, and the Roman legions were combined in one for his utter destruction: &quot;Away with such a fellow from this earth; it is not fit that he should live,&quot; was the shout of his ferocious foes. David&#39;s adversaries were on the throne when he was hiding in caverns, and our Lord&#39;s enemies were the great ones of the earth ; while he, of whom the world was not worthy, was reproached of men and despised of the people. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Then </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>restored </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>took </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>away.&quot; </span>Though innocent, he was treated as guilty. Though David had no share in plots against Saul, yet he was held accountable for them. In reference to our Lord, it may be truly said that he restores what he took not away; for he gives back to the injured honour of God a recompense, and to man his lost happiness, though the insult of the one and the fall of the other were neither of them, in any sense, his doings. Usually, when the ruler sins the people suffer, but here the proverb is reversed&#8212;the sheep go astray, and their wanderings are laid at the Shepherd&#39;s door.</p>

That which was foolishness to men was superlative wisdom before God. How often might we use these words in their natural sense, and if we were not such fools as to be blind to our own folly, this confession would be frequently on our lips. When we feel that we have been foolish we are not, therefore, to cease from prayer, but rather to be more eager and fervent in it.

It ought to render confession easy, when we are assured that all is known already. That prayer which has no confession in it may please a Pharisee&#39;s pride, but will never bring down justification. They who have never seen their sins in the light of God&#39;s omniscience are quite unable to appeal to that omniscience in proof of their piety. He who can say, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>knowest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>foolishness,&quot; </span>is the only man who can add, &quot;But thou knowest that I love thee.&quot;</p>

Unbelievers are ready enough to catch at anything which may turn humble faith into ridicule, therefore, O God of all the armies of Israel, let not my case cause the enemy to blaspheme&#8212; such is the spirit of this verse. Our blessed Lord ever had a tender concern for his people, and would not have his own oppression of spirit become a source of discouragement to them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>those </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>seek </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>confounded </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><i>sake, O </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel.&quot; </span>He appealed to the Lord of hosts by his power to help him, and now to the God of Israel by his covenant faithfulness to come to the rescue. If the captain of the host fail, how will it fare with the rank and file? If David flee, what will his followers do? If the king of believers shall find his faith unrewarded, how will the feeble ones hold on their way? Our Lord&#39;s behaviour during his sharpest agonies is no cause of shame to us; he wept, for he was man, but he murmured not, for he was sinless man; he cried, &quot;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me ;&quot; for he was human, but he added, &quot;Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt,&quot; for his humanity was without taint of rebellion. In the depths of tribulation no repining word escaped him, for there was no repining in his heart. The Lord of martyrs witnessed a good confession. He was strengthened in the hour of peril, and came off more than a conqueror, as we also shall do, if we hold fast our confidence even to the end.</p>

The bottom of the quarrel was, that God was with him, and he with God, while the Scribes ana Pharisees sought only their own honour. Reproach is at all times very cutting to a man of integrity, and it must have come with acute force upon one of so unsullied a character as our Lord; yet see, how he turns to his God, and finds his consolation in the fact that he is enduring all for his Father&#39;s sake.

Moreover,&quot; they passed him through the trial of cruel mockings, besmeared his face with spittle, and covered it with bruises, so that Pilate&#39;s &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; called the world&#39;s attention to an unexampled spectacle of woe and shame. The stripping on the cross must also have suffused the Redeemer&#39;s face with a modest blush, as he hung there exposed to the cruel gaze of a ribald multitude. Ah, blessed Lord, it was our shame which thou wast made to bear! Nothing more deserves to be reproached and despised than sin, and lo, when thou wast made sin for us thou wast called to endure abuse and scorn. Blessed be thy name it is over now, but we owe thee more than heart can conceive for thine amazing stoop of love.</span></p>

Some men are eaten up with lechery, others with covetousness, and a third class with pride, but the master-passion with our great leader was the glory of God, jealousy for his name, and love to the divine family. Zeal for God is so little understood by men of the world, that it always draws down opposition upon those who are inspired with it; they are sure to be accused of sinister motives, or of hypocrisy, or of being out of their senses. When zeal eats us up, ungodly men seek to eat us up too, and this was pre-eminently the case with our Lord, because his holy jealousy was preeminent. With more than a seraph&#39;s fire he glowed, and consumed himself with his fervour. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reproaches </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reproached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>/alien </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>Those who habitually blasphemed God now curse me instead.

Nothing is more cruel than prejudice, its eye colours all with the medium through which it looks, and its tongue rails at all indiscriminately. Our Saviour wept much in secret for our sins, and no doubt his private soul-chastenings on our behalf were very frequent. Lone mountains and desert places saw repeated agonies, which, if they could disclose them, would astonish us indeed. The emaciation which these exercises wrought in our Lord made him appear nearly fifty years old when he was but little over thirty; this which was to his honour was used as a matter of reproach against him.</p>

The flavour of slander is piquante, and gives a relish to the revellers&#39; wine. The character of the man of Nazareth was so far above the appreciation of the men of strength to mingle strong drink, it was so much out of their way and above their thoughts, that it is no wonder it seemed to them ridiculous, and therefore well adapted to create laughter over their cups. The saints are ever choice subjects for satire. Butler&#39;s Hudibras owed more of its popularity to its irreligious banter than to any intrinsic cleverness. To this day the re makes rare fun of the tabernacle, and the ale-bench is the seat of the scorner. What a wonder of condescension is here that he who is the adoration of angels should stoop to be the song of drunkards! What amazing sin that he whom seraphs worship with veiled faces should be the scornful proverb among the most abandoned of men.</p>

perfect one makes his appeal to the rich mercy of God, much more should we. To misery no attribute is more sweet than mercy, and when sorrows multiply, the multitude of mercy is much prized. When enemies are more than the hairs of our head, they are yet to be numbered, but God&#39;s mercies are altogether innumerable, and let it never be forgotten that every one of them is an available and powerful argument in the hand of faith, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation. </span>&quot;Jehovah&#39;s faithfulness is a further mighty plea.

Our Lord teaches us here the sacred art of wrestling in prayer, and ordering our cause with arguments; and he also indicates to us that the nature of God is the great treasury of strong reasons, which shall be to us most prevalent in supplication.</span></p>

He was baptised in agony but not drowned in it; the grave enclosed him, but before she could close her mouth he had burst his prison. It is said that truth lies in a well, but it is assuredly an open well, for it walks abroad in power; and so our great Substitute in the pit of woe and death was yet the Conqueror of death and hell. How appropriately may many of us use this prayer. We deserve to be swept away as with a flood, to be drowned in our sins, to be shut up in hell; let us, then, plead the merits of our Saviour, lest these things happen unto us.</p>

It is the gall of bitterness to be without the comfortable smile of God ; in our Lord&#39;s case his grief culminated in &quot; Lama Sabachthani,&quot; and his bitterest cry was that in which he mourned an absent God. Observe how he dwells anew upon divine tenderness, and touches again that note of abundance, &quot;The multitude of thy compassions.&quot;</p>

The standing consolation of the godly is the experience of their Lord, for as he is so are we also in this world ; yea, moreover, his triumph has secured ours, and therefore, we may on the most solid grounds rejoice in him.

No portion of the Old Testament Scriptures is more frequently quoted in the New, with the exception of Psalm xxii. When Jesus drives the buyers and sellers from the temple (John ii. 17), his disciples are reminded of the words of verse 9 (first clause). When it is said (John xv. 25) that the enemies of Jesus hated him without a cause, and this is looked upon as the fulfilment of Scripture, the reference is probably to verse 4, though it may be also to xxxv. 18. To him, and the reproach which he endured for the sake of God, St. Paul refers the words of this Psalm, verse 9 (second clause): &quot;The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.&quot; In verse 12 we have a foreshadowing of the mockery of our Lord by the soldiers in the pretorium (Matt. xxvii. 27&#8212;30); in verse 21, the giving of the vinegar and the gall found their counterpart in the scenes of the crucifixion, Matt, xxvii. 34. In John xix. 28, there is an allusion, probably to verse 21 of this Psalm, and to xxii. 15. The imprecation in verse 25 is said, in Acts i. 20, to have been fulfilled in the case of Judas Iscariot, though, as the words of the Psalm are plural, the citation is evidently made with some freedom.

XI. 9, 10, the rejection of Israel may best be described in the words of verses 22, 23.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stewart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Perowne. </span></p>

One of the men was, therefore, sent in the small boat; but the river, near the western side, was <span style='font-style:italic;'>so </span>shallow that he could not get the boat within some distance of the bank. He, consequently, as is usual in such cases, jumped overboard that he might carry me to the boat on his back. No sooner, however, had he sprung from the boat than I heard him scream. I turned to see what was the matter, when I found him struggling in the mud. He was sinking as though in quicksand ; and the more he struggled, the faster and deeper he sank. His fellow-boatmen were not slack. They quickly saw the dilemma he was in, and two of them dashed into the water and swam to the small boat. I was almost choked with terror, and I breathed, or rather gasped, with difficulty. &quot;Can they reach the poor fellow?&quot; I said to myself; &quot;if not, he must inevitably be swallowed up alive!&quot; Now they reach the boat! Now they near him! And now, praise the Lord, he grasps firmly hold. O that death-like grasp of the side of the boat! But this was not until he had sunk up to his bosom! Seeing him safe, I breathed more freely ; and I feel that now, though only relating the circumstance, the excitement has caused an increased and painful action of the heart. How I thought of poor David! Had he really witnessed a similar scene to this literally when, speaking of the feelings of his soul, spiritually, he said: &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>sink </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mire, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>where </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>standing: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>where </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>floods </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>overflow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me&quot;? </span>0 what an agonising state to be in ! and yet many of my readers, I have no doubt, who never witnessed such a scene literally, know something about it spiritually, as David did, whether he had seen it with his bodily eyes or not. Well might he, in the struggling of his soul, exclaim: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Deliver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mire, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sink </span>/&quot; Let me grasp firmly hold of the ark, and be pulled safely on board!
