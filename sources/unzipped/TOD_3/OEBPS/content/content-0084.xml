To such he is, and must be, goodness itself. The writer does not doubt this, but lays it down as his firm conviction. It is well to make sure of what we do know, for this will be good anchor-hold for us when we are molested by those mysterious storms which arise from things which we do not understand. Whatever may or may not be the truth about mysterious and inscrutable things, there are certainties somewhere; experience has placed some tangible facts within our grasp; let us, then, cling to these, and they will prevent our being carried away by those hurricanes of infidelity which still come from the wilderness, and, like whirlwinds, smite the four corners of our house and threaten to overthrow it. O my God, however perplexed I may be, let me never think ill of thee. If I cannot understand thee, let me never cease to believe in thee. It must be so, it cannot be otherwise, thou art good to those whom thou hast made good; and where thou hast renewed the heart thou wilt not leave it to its enemies.</p>

The Lord is good to his saints, &quot;<i>but </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span>me,&quot; Am I one of them? Can I expect to share his grace?

There is an intimate connection between the heart and the feet. Asaph could barely stand, his uprightness was going, his knees were bowing like a falling wall. &quot;&#39;&quot;When men doubt the righteousness of God, their own integrity begins to waver. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>steps </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>had </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>well </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nigh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>slipped.&quot; </span>Asaph could make no progress in the good road, his feet ran away from under him like those of a man on a sheet of ice. He was weakened for all practical action, and in great danger of actual sin, and so of a disgraceful fall. How ought we to watch the inner man, since it has so forcible an effect upon the outward character. The confession in this case is, as it should be, very plain and explicit.</p>

It is a pitiful thing that an heir of heaven should have to confess &quot; I was envious,&quot; but worse still that he should have to put it, &quot;I was envious at the foolish.&quot; Yet this acknowledgment is, we fear,<a id='GBS.PA340.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.355.1.0.box.234.281.1304.241.q.60'>

The notion is still prevalent that a quiet death means a happy hereafter. The psalmist had observed that the very reverse is true. Careless persons become case-hardened, and continue presumptuously secure, even to the last. Some are startled at the approach of judgment, but many more have received a strong delusion to believe a lie. What with the surgeon&#39;s drugs and their own infidelity, or false peace, they glide into eternity without a struggle. We have seen godly men bound with doubts, and fettered with anxieties, which have arisen from their holy jealousy; but the godless know nothing of such bands: they care neither for God nor devil. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>i&#187; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>firm.&quot; </span>What care they for death? Frequently they are brazen and insolent, and can vent defiant blasphemies even on their last couch. This may occasion sorrow and surprise among saints, but certainly should not suggest envy, for, in this case, the most terrible inward conflict is infinitely to be preferred to the profoundest calm which insolent presumption can create. Let the righteous die as they may, let my last end be like theirs.</p>

While many saints are both poor and afflicted, the prosperous sinner is neither. He is worse than other men, and yet he is better off; he ploughs least, and yet has the most fodder. He deserves the hottest hell, and yet has the warmest nest. All this is clear to the eye of faith, which unriddles the riddle ; but to the bleared eye of sense it seems an enigma indeed. They are to have nothing hereafter, let them have what they can here; they, after all, only possess what is of secondary value, and their possessing it is meant to teach us to set little store by transient things. If earthly good were of much value, the Lord would not give so large a measure of it to those who have least of his love.</p>

What are they made for? What, indeed, but to toil and slave that men of education and good family may enjoy themselves? Out on the knaves for prating about their rights! A set of wily demagogues are stirring them up, because they get a living by agitation.

They themselves are, beyond measure, worthy of all honour, and all the rest of mankind, except a few of their parasites, are knaves, fools, hypocrites, or worse. When these men&#39;s tongues are out for a walk, they are unhappy who meet them, for they push all travellers into the kennel: it is impossible altogether to avoid them, for in both hemispheres they take their perambulations, both on land and sea they make their voyages. The city is not free from them, and the village swarms with them. They waylay men in the king&#39;s highway, but they are able to hunt across country, too.

Asaph was a seer, but he could not see when reason left him in the dark; over seers must have the sunlight of revealed truth to see by, or they grope like the blind.

Rest was given to the disturbers, and yet peace was denied to the peace-makers. The downcast seer was in a muse and a maze. The affairs of mankind appeared to him to be in a fearful tangle; how could it be permitted by a just ruler that things should be so turned upside down, and the whole course of justice dislocated.</p>

From such a man as the psalmist, the utterance which his discontent suggested would have been a heavy blow and deep discouragement to the whole brotherhood. He dared not, therefore, come to such a resolution, but paused, and would not decide to declare his feelings. It was well, for in his case second thoughts were by far the best. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>should </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>offend </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>generation </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>children.&#39;&#39; </span>I should scandalize them, grieve them, and perhaps cause them to offend also. We ought to look at the consequences of our speech to all others, and especially to the church of God. Woe unto the man by whom offence cometh! Rash, undigested, illconsidered speech, is responsible for much of the heart-burning and trouble in the churches. Would to God that, like Asaph, men would bridle their tongues. Where we have any suspicion of being wrong, it is better to be silent; it can do no harm to be quiet, and it may do serious damage to spread abroad our hastily formed opinions. To grieve the children of God by appearing to act perfidiously and betray the truth, is a sin so heinous, that if the consciences of heresy-mongers were not seared as with a hot iron, they would not be so glib as they are to publish abroad their novelties. Expressions which convey the impression that the Lord acts unjustly or unkindly, especially if they fall from the lips of men of known character and experience, are as dangerous as firebrands among stubble; they are used for blasphemous purposes by the ill-disposed; and the timid and trembling are sure to be cast down thereby, and to find reason for yet deeper distress of soul.</p>

To speak might have relieved one sorrow, but, as it would have created another, he forbore so dangerous a remedy; yet this did not remove the first pangs, which grew even worse and worse, and threatened utterly to overwhelm him. A smothered grief is hard to endure. The triumph of conscience which compels us to keep the wolf hidden beneath our own garments, does not forbid its gnawing at our vitals. Suppressed fire in the bones rages more fiercely than if it could gain a vent at the mouth. Those who know Asaph&#39;s dilemma will pity him as none others can.</p>

The motions of the planets appear most discordant from this world which is itself a planet; they appear as &quot;progressive, retrograde, and standing still ;&quot; but could we fix our observatory in the sun, which is the centre of the system, we should perceive all the planets moving in perfect circles around the head of the great solar family. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Then </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>understood </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>end.&quot; </span>He had seen too little to be able to judge; a wider view changed his judgment; he saw with his mind&#39;s enlightened eye the future of the wicked, and his soul was in debate no longer as to the happiness of their condition. No envy gnaws now at his heart, but a holy horror both of their impending doom, and of their present guilt, fills his soul. He recoils from being dealt with in the same manner as the proud sinners, whom just now he regarded with admiration.</p>

The Psalmist&#39;s sorrow had culminated, not in the fact that the ungodly prospered, but that God had arranged it soI had it happened by mere chance, he would have wondered, but could not have complained; but how the arranger of all things could so dispense his temporal favours, was the vexatious question. Here, to meet the case, he sees that the divine hand purposely placed these men in prosperous and eminent circumstances, not with the intent to bless them but the very reverse. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Surely </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>didst </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>set </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>slippery </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>places.&quot; </span>Their position was dangerous, and, therefore, God did not set his friends there but his foes alone.

They were but elevated by judicial arrangement for the fuller execution of their doom. Eternal punishment will be all the more terrible in contrast with the former prosperity of those who are ripening for it. Taken as a whole, the case of the ungodly is horrible throughout; and their worldly joy instead of diminishing the horror, actually renders the effect the more awful, even as the vivid lightning amid the storm does not brighten but intensify the thick darkness which lowers around. The ascent to the fatal gallows of Haman was an essential ingredient in the terror of the sentence&#8212;&quot; hang him thereon.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>If </span>the wicked had not been raised so high they could not have fallen so low.</p>

When God awakes to judgment, they who despise him shall be despised ; they are already &quot;such stuff as dreams are made of,&quot; but then the baseless fabric shall not leave a wreck behind.

The holy poet here reviews his inward struggle and awards himself censure for his folly. His pain had been intense; he says, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><i>grieved.&quot; </i>It was a deep-seated sorrow, and one which penetrated his inmost being. Alexander reads it, &quot;My heart is soured.&quot; His spirit had become embittered; he had judged in a harsh, crabbed, surly manner. He had become atrabilarious, full of black bile, melancholy, and choleric; he had poisoned his own life at the fountain-head, and made all its streams to be bitter as gall. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><i>I </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><i>pricked </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reins.&quot; </span>He was as full of pain as a man afflicted with renal disease; he had pierced himself through with many sorrows; his hard thoughts were like so many calculi in his kidneys; he was utterly wretched and woebegone, and all through his own reflections. O miserable philosophy, which stretches the mind on the rack, and breaks it on the wheel! O blessed faith, which drives away the inquisitors, and sets the captives free!</p>

Had he not even envied them ?&#8212;and what is that but to aspire to be like them? The wisest of men have enough folly in them to ruin them unless grace prevents. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorant.&quot; </span>He had acted as if he knew nothing, had babbled like an idiot, had uttered the very drivel of a witless loon. He did not know how sufficiently to express his sense of his own fatuity. <span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>beast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&quot; </span>Even in God&#39;s presence he had been brutish, and worse than a beast. As the grass-eating ox has but this present life, and can only estimate things thereby, and by the sensual pleasure which they afford, even so had the psalmist judged happiness by this mortal life, by outward appearances, and by fleshly enjoyments. Thus he had, for the time, renounced the dignity of an immortal spirit, and, like a mere animal, judged after the sight of the eyes. We should be very loth to call an inspired man a beast, and yet, penitence made him call himself so; nay, he uses the plural, by way of emphasis, and as if he were worse than any one beast. It was but an evidence of his true wisdom that he was so deeply conscious of his own folly. We see how bitterly good men bewail mental wanderings; they make no excuses for themselves, but set their sins in the pillory, and cast the vilest reproaches upon them. O for grace to detest the very appearance of evil!</p>

Sin may distress us, and yet we may be in communion with God. It is sin beloved and delighted in which separates us from the Lord, but when we bewail it heartily, the Lord will not withdraw from us. What a contrast is here in this and the former verse! He is as a beast, and yet continually with God. Our double nature, as it always causes conflict, so is it a continuous paradox : the flesh allies us with the brutes, and the spirit affiliates us to God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>holden </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>right </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand.&quot; </span>With love dost thou embrace me, with honour ennoble me, with power uphold me. He had almost fallen, and yet was always upheld. He was a riddle to himself, as he had been a wonder unto many. This verse contains the two precious mercies of communion and upholding, and as they were both given to one who confessed himself a fool, we also may hope to enjoy them.</p>

Fresh from the conflict, he somewhat abruptly opens the Psalm with the confident enunciation of the truth of which victory over doubt had now made him more and more intelligently sure than ever, that <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>such </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>clean </span><i>heart.&quot; </i>And then he relates the most fatal shock which his faith had received, when he contrasted the prosperity of the wicked, who, though they proudly contemned God and man, prospered in the world and increased in riches, with his own lot, who, though he had cleansed his heart and washed his hands in innocency, had been &quot; plagued all the day long and chastened every morning.&quot; The place where his doubts were removed and his tottering faith re-established, was &quot;the sanctuary of God.&quot; God himself was the Teacher. What, then, did he teach? By what divinely imparted considerations was the psalmist reassured? Whatever is the proper rendering of the fourth verse; whether, &quot;There are no sorrows (tending) to their death,&quot; or, &quot;There are no sorrows <span style='font-style:italic;'>until </span>their death,&quot;&#8212;their whole life to the very last is one unchequered course of happiness&#8212;that verse conveys to us the psalmist&#39;s <span style='font-style:italic;'>mis</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>taken </span>estimate of the prosperity of the wicked, before he went unto the sanctuary of God. The true estimate, at which he afterwards arrived, is found in verses 18&#8212;20. Now, admitting (what, by the way, is somewhat difficult of belief, inasmuch as the sudden and fearful temporal destruction of <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>or even the <span style='font-style:italic;'>most </span>prosperous cannot be made out) that the end of these men &quot;means only and always their end <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>world, </span>we come to the conclusion that, in the case of the wicked, this Psalm does not plainly and undeniably teach that punishment awaits them after death ; but only that, in estimating their condition, it is necessary, in order to vindicate the justice of God, to take in their whole career, and set over against their great prosperity the sudden and fearful reverses and destruction which they not unfrequently encounter. But, in turning to the other side of the comparison, the case of the righteous, we are <span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span>met by the thought, that as the prosperity of the wicked is but the preparation for their ruin, the raising higher the tower that the fall may be the greater, so the adversity of the godly is but an introduction to worldly wealth and honour. That thought is not foreign to the Old Testament writers. &quot;Evildoers shall be cut off ;&quot; writes one of them, &quot; but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.&quot; Psalm xxxvii. 9&#8212;11. <span style='font-style:italic;'>But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>so </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>much </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hinted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>here. </span>The daily chastening may continue, flesh and heart may fail, but God is good to Israel notwithstanding: he is their portion, their guide, their help while they live, and he will take them to his glorious presence when they die. &quot;Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt.guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.&quot; The New Testament has nothing higher or more spiritual than this. The reference of the last clause to happiness after death is, I believe, generally<a id='GBS.PA348.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.363.1.0.box.248.293.1273.105.q.60'>

He observes (verses 2 and 3), &quot;As for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.&quot; In the fourth and following verses he informs us what, in the wicked, was his temptation. In the first place, he observed, that they were <span style='font-style:italic;'>prosperous, </span>and all things went well with them. He then observed their <span style='font-style:italic;'>behaviour </span>in their prosperity, and the use which they made of it; and that God, notwithstanding such abuse, <span style='font-style:italic;'>continued </span>their prosperity. Then he tells us, by what means he was helped out of this difficulty, viz., by going into the <span style='font-style:italic;'>sanctuary </span>(verses 16 and 17), and proceeds to inform us what considerations they were which helped him, viz.&#8212; 1. The consideration of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>miserable </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>end </span>of wicked men. However they prosper for the present, yet they come to a woeful end at last (verses 18&#8212;20). 2. The consideration of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>end </span>of the saints. Althougn the saints, while they live, may be afflicted, yet they come to a happy end at last (verses 21 &#8212;24). 3. The consideration that the godly have a much <span style='font-style:italic;'>better </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>portion </span>than the wicked, even though they have no other portion but God; as in verses 25, 26. Though the wicked are in prosperity, and are not in trouble as other men; yet the godly, though in affliction, are in B state infinitely better, because they have God for their portion. They need desire nothing else: he that hath God hath all. Thus the psalmist professes the sense and apprehension which he had of things: &quot;Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.&quot; In the twenty-fourth verse the psalmist takes notice how the saints are happy in God, both when they are in this world and also when they are taken to another. They are blessed in God in this world, in that <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>guides </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>counsel</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>and when he takes them out of it they are still happy, in that he <span style='font-style:italic;'>receives </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory. </span>This probably led him to declare that he desired <span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>other </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>portion, </span>either in this world or in that to come, either in heaven or upon earth.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Jonathan </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Edwards. </span></p>

Little pearls are of great price. And this small particle is not of small use, being rightly applied and improved. First, take it (as our translators gave it us) as <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>note </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>asseveration. </span><i>&quot;Truly.&quot; </i>It&#39;s a word of faith, opposite to the psalmist&#39;s sense and Satan&#39;s injections. Whatsoever sense sees or feels, whatsoever Satan insinuates and says; yet precious faith with confidence asserts, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Truly, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>verily </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><i>good.&quot; </i>He is not only good in word, but in deed also. Not only seemingly good, but certainly good. Secondly, consider it as <span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>adversative </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>particle, </span>&quot;Pitf,&quot; so our old translation. Ainsworth renders it, <span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>surely</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>taking in the former and this together. And then the sense runs thus: How ill soever things go in the world, how ill soever it fares with God&#39;s church and people amongst men, <span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span>to Israel. Thirdly, some conceive that the word carries <span style='font-style:italic;'>admiration. </span>Oh, how good is God to Israel. Where expressions and apprehensions fail, there the psalmist takes up God&#39;s providences with admiration. Oh, how wonderfully, how transcendently good is God to Israel!</p>

And the psalmist seems to begin somewhat abruptly. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>But having filled his thoughts with his former follies and fears, and now seeing himself in a safe condition both for the present and the future, he is full of confidence and comfort; and that which was the strongest and chiefest in his heart now breaks out first: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>1. This &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet&quot; </span>relates unto his sufferings, verse 14: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;All </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>day </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>long </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><i>I </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>been </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>plagued, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>chastened </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>every </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>morning.&quot; </span>Notwithstanding the variety and frequency of the saint&#39;s sufferings, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>Though sorrow salutes them every morning at their first awaking, and trouble attends them to bed at night, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>Though temptations many and terrible make batteries and breeches upon their spirits, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel.&quot; </span>2. This <sup>&quot;</sup><span style='font-style:italic;'>yet&quot; </span>reflects upon his sinnings, the frettings and wrangliugs of his distempered heart (verses 2, 3, and verse 21). Though sinful motions do mutiny in the soul against God&#39;s wise administrations, though there be foolish, proud quarrellings with divine providences, and inexcusable distrust of his faithful promises; though fretfulness at others&#39; prosperity and discontent at their own adversity, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>Israel&#39;s sinful distempers cause not the Almighty to change the course of his accustomed goodness. While corruptions are kept from breaking out into scandal, while the soul contends against them, and is humbled for them (as the psalmist was), this conclusion must be maintained: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>isgood.&quot; </span>3. This &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span>&quot; looks back upon his misgivings. There had been distrustful despondency upon the good man&#39;s heart. For from both the premises (viz., his sufferings and sinnings) he had inferred this conclusion, verse 13, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Verily </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cleansed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vain, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><i>washed </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>innocency.&quot; </span>As if he had said, &quot;I have kept fasts, observed Sabbaths, heard sermons, made prayers, received sacraments, given alms, avoided sins, resisted temptations, withstood lusts, appeared for Christ and his cause and servants in vain: yea, his heart had added an asseveration <span style='font-style:italic;'>(verily) </span>to this faithless opinion, but now he is of another mind: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>The administrations of God are not according to the sad surmises of his people&#39;s misgiving hearts. For, though they through diffidence are apt often to give up their holy labours as lost, and all their conscientious care and carriage as utterly cast away; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Simeon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ash, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><i>entitled </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;God&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Incomparable </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel.&quot; </span>1647.</p>

As a brave and valiant champion, he had been exercised in very painful struggles and temptations; but, after long and arduous exertion, he at length succeeded in shaking off all perverse imaginations, and came to the conclusion that <span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span>God is gracious to his servants, and the faithful guardian of their welfare. Thus these words contain a tacit contrast between the unhallowed imaginations suggested to him by Satan, and the testimony in favour of true religion with which he now strengthens himself, denouncing, as it were, the judgment of the flesh, in giving place to misgiving thoughts with respect to the providence of God. We see, then, how emphatic ally this exclamation of the psalmist. He does not ascend into the chair to dispute after the manner of the philosophers, and to deliver his discourse in a style of studied oratory; but, as if he had escaped from hell, he proclaims with a loud voice, and with impassioned feeling, that he had obtained the victory.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>
