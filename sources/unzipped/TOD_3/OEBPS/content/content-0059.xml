The hackneyed story of the refiner seeing his image in the molten silver while in the fire, has so charmed most of us, that we have not looked further; yet, with more careful study, much could be brought out.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA193.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.208.1.1.box.77.401.1282.497.q.60'><span style='font-style:italic;'>To </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>assay </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>silver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>requires </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>great </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>personal </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>care </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>operator. </span>&quot;The principle of assaying gold and silver is very simple theoretically, but in practice great experience is necessary to insure accuracy; and there is no branch of business which demands more personal and undivided attention. The result is liable to the influence of so many contingencies, that no assayer who regards his reputation will delegate the principal processes to one not equally skilled with himself. Besides the result ascertainable by weight, there are allowances and compensations to be made, which are known only to an experienced assayer, and if these were disregarded, as might be the case with the mere novice, the report would be wide from the truth.&quot; * Pagnini&#39;s version reads: &quot;Thou hast melted us by blowing upon us,&quot; and in the monuments of Egypt, artificers are seen with the blowpipe operating with small fire-places, with cheeks to confine and reflect the heat; the worker evidently paying personal attention, which is evident also in Malachi iii. 3, &quot; He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.&quot;</p>

Even the trial of our faith is much more precious than that of gold which perisheth. He has refined us, but not with silver, he would not trust us there, the furnace of affliction is far more skilfully arranged than that.</p>

One indication of an excess of heat in the furnace, is the rapid and perpendicular rising of the fumes to the ceiling of the muffle, the mode of checking and controlling which has been pointed out in the description of the improved furnace. When the fumes are observed to fall to the bottom of the muffle, the furnace is then too cold ; and, if left unaltered, it will be found that the cupellation has been imperfectly performed, and the silver will not have entirely freed itself from the base metals.&quot; *</p>

Here are cruel Nimrods riding over innocent heads, as they would over fallow lands; and dangerous passages through fire and water; but the storm is soon ended, or rather the passengers are landed. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>broughtest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wealthy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>place.&#39;&#39; </span>So that this strain of David&#39;s music, or psalmody, consists of two notes&#8212;one mournful, the other mirthful; the one a touch of distress, the other of redress: which directs our course to an observation of <span style='font-style:italic;'>misery </span>and of <span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>of grievous misery, of gracious mercy. There is desolation and consolation in one verse : a deep dejection, as laid under the feet of beasts; a happy deliverance, &quot;<i>brought </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><i>wealthy </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>place.&quot; </span>In both these strains God hath his stroke; he is a principal in this concert. He is brought in for an <span style='font-style:italic;'>actor, </span>and for an <span style='font-style:italic;'>author; </span>an actor in the persecution, an author in the deliverance. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>causcst,<sup>&quot;</sup> </span>etc.; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>broughtest,&quot; </span>etc. In the one he is a causing worker; in the other a sole working cause. In the one he is joined with company ; in the other he works alone, He hath a finger in the former; his whole hand in the latter. We must begin with <span style='font-style:italic;'>misery </span>before we come to <span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy. </span>If there were no trouble, we should not know the worth of a deliverance. The passion of the saints is given, by the hearty and ponderous description, for very grievous; yet it is written in the forehead of the text, &quot;The Lord caused it.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><i>caused </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>men </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><i>ride,&quot; </i>etc. Hereupon, some wicked libertine may offer to rub his filthiness upon God&#39;s purity, and to plead an authentical derivation of all his villany against the saints from the Lord&#39;s warrant: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>caused </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it.&quot; </span>We answer, to the justification of truth itself, that God doth ordain and order every persecution that striketh his children, without any allowance to the instrument that gives the blow. God works in the same action with others, not after the same manner. In the affliction of Job were three agents&#8212;God, Satan, and the Sabeans. The devil works on his body, the Sabeans on his goods; yet Job confesseth a third party: &quot;The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away.&quot; Here oppressors trample on the godly, and God is said to cause it. He causeth affliction for trial (so verses 10, 11 : &quot;Thou hast tried us,&quot; etc.) ; they work it for malice; neither can God be accused nor they excused.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Adams. </span></p>

Now, the cause of vehemence, in our prosecution of any good, is our love of it; for proportionable to the affection we bear to anything is the earnestness of our desires and the diligence of our pursuit after it. So long, therefore, as the love of sin possesses our hearts, our love to spiritual things is dull, heavy, inactive, and our prayers for them must needs be answerable. O the wretched fallacy that the soul will here put upon itself! At the same time it will love its sin and pray against it; at the same time it will entreat for grace, with a desire not to prevail: as a father confesses of himself, that before his conversion he would pray for chastity, with a secret reserve in his wishes that God would not grant his prayer. Such are the mysterious, intricate treacheries by which the love of sin will make a soul deceive and circumvent itself. How languidly and faintly will it pray for spiritual mercies; conscience, in the meanwhile, giving the lie to every such petition! The soul, in this case, cannot pray against sin in earnest; it fights against it, but neither with hope nor intent to conquer; as lovers, usually, in a game one against another, with a desire to lose. So, then, while we regard iniquity, how is it possible for us to regard spiritual things, the only lawful object of our prayers <span style='font-style:italic;'>i </span>and, if we regard them not, how can we be urgent with God for the giving of them? And where there is no fervency on our part, no wonder if there is no answer on God&#39;s.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>South, </span>1633&#8212;1716.</span></p>

Take, I confess, a Christian in his right temper, and he aims at the glory of God ; yet, as a needle that is touched with a loadstone may be removed from its point to which nature hath espoused it, though trembling till it again recovers it; so a gracious soul may in a particular act and request vary from this end, being jogged by Satan, yea, disturbed by an enemy nearer home&#8212;his own unmortified corruption. Do you not think it possible for a saint, in distress of body and spirit, to pray for health in the one, and comfort in the other, with too selfish a respect ito his own ease and quiet? Yes, surely ; and to pray for gifts and assistance in some eminent service, with an eye to his own credit and applause; to pray for a child with too inordinate a desire that the honour of his house may be built up in him.

That which in the first or second degree is wholesome food, would be rank poison in the fourth or fifth: therefore, Christian, catechize thyself, before thou prayest: 0, my soul, what sends thee on this errand <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>Know but thy own mind what thou prayest for, and thou mayest soon know God&#39;s mind how thou shalt speed.

They regard iniquity in their heart, who reflect upon past sins with delight, or without sincere humiliation of mind. Perhaps our real disposition, both towards sin and duty, may be as certainly discovered by the state of our minds after, as in the time of action. The strength and suddeness of temptation may betray even a good man into the commission of sin ; the backwardness of heart and power of inward corruption may make duty burdensome and occasion many defects in the performance ; but every real Christian remembers his past sins with unfeigned contrition of spirit, and a deep sense of unworthiness before God; and the discharge of his duty, however difficult it may have been at the time, affords him the utmost pleasure on reflection. It is otherwise with many ; they can remember their sins without sorrow, they can speak of them without shame, and sometimes even with a mixture of boasting and vain glory. Did you never hear them recall their past follies, and speak of them with such relish, that it seems to be more to renew the pleasure than to regret the sin? Even supposing such persons to have forsaken the practice of some sin, if they can thus look upon them with inward complacency, their seeming reformation must be owing to a very different cause from renovation of heart.</p>

They regard iniquity in the heart, who look upon the sins of others with approbation ; or, indeed, who can behold them without grief. Sin is so abominable a thing, so dishonouring to God, and so destructive to the souls of men, that no real Christian can witness it without concern. Hence it is so frequently taken notice of in Scripture, as the character of a servant of God, that he mourns for the sins of others. Ps. cxix. 136, 158.</p>

In the last place, I suspect that they regard sin in the heart, who are backward to bring themselves to the trial, and who are not truly willing that God himself would search and try them.
