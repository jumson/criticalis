The more intimate we are with the Lord, the firmer will our trust be.

as much at home as a man in his own house, and then suffer me to remain in thee as my settled abode. Whereas foes molest me, I need a dwelling framed and bulwarked, to sustain a siege and resist the attacks of armies; let, then, thine omnipotence secure me, and be as a fortress unto me. Here we see a weak man, but he is in a strong habitation ; his security rests upon the tower in which he hides, and is not placed in jeopardy through his personal feebleness. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Whereunto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>continually </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>resort.&quot; </span>Fast shut is this castle against all adversaries, its gates they cannot burst open; the drawbridge is up, the portcullis is down, the bars are fast in their places; but, there is a secret door, by which friends of the great Lord can enter at all hours of the day or night, as often as ever they please. There is never an hour when it is unlawful to pray. Mercy&#39;s gates stand wide open, and shall do so, till, at the last, the Master of the house has risen up and shut to the door. Believers find their God to be their habitation, strong and accessible, and this is for them a sufficient remedy for all the ills of their mortal life. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>given </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>commandment </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>save </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>Nature is charged to be tender with God&#39;s servants; Providence is ordered to work their good, and the forces of the invisible world are ordained as their guardians. David charged all his troops to spare the young man Absalom, but yet he fell. God&#39;s commandment is of far higher virtue, for it compels obedience, and secures its end. Destruction cannot destroy us, famine cannot starve us; but we laugh at both, while God&#39;s mandate shields us. No stones of the field can throw us down, while angels bear us up in their hands; neither can the beasts of the field devour us, while David&#39;s God delivers us from their ferocity, or Daniel&#39;s God puts them in awe of us. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rock </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><i>for </i>tress.&quot; In God we have all the security which nature which furnishes the rock, and art which builds the fortress, could supply ; he is the complete preserver of his people. Immutability may be set forth by the rock, and omnipotence by the fortress. Happy is he who can use the personal pronoun &quot;my&quot;&#8212;not only once, but as many times as the many aspects cl the Lord may render desirable. Is he a strong habitation? I will call him &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>strong habitation,&quot; and he shall be <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>rock, <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>fortress, <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>God (verse 4), <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>hope, <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>trust (verse 5), <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>praise (verse 6). All mine shall be his, all his shall be mine. This was the reason why the psalmist was persuaded that God had commanded his salvation, namely, because he had enabled him to exercise a calm and appropriating faith.</span></p>

Alas for us, if we were abandoned by our God, as many a courtier has been by his prince! Old age robs us of personal beauty, and deprives us of strength for active service; but it does not lower us in the love and layout of God. An ungrateful country leaves its worn-out defenders to starve upon a scanty pittance, but the pensioners of heaven are satisfied with good things. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Forsake </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faileth.&quot; </span>Bear with me, and endure my infirmities.

The faithfulness of God in saving us, in delivering us out of the hand of our enemies, and in fulfilling his promises, is to be everywhere proclaimed by those who have proved it in their own history. How gloriously conspicuous is righteousness in the divine plan of redemption! It should be the theme of constant discourse. The devil rages against the substitutionary sacrifice, and errorists of every form make this the main point of their attack; be it ours, therefore, to love the doctrine, and to spread its glad tidings on every side, and at all times. Mouths are never so usefully employed as in recounting the righteousness of God revealed in the salvation of believers in Jesus. The preacher who should be confined to this one theme would never need seek another: it is the <span style='font-style:italic;'>medulla </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>theologia, </span>the very pith and marrow of revealed truth.

Lord, where I cannot count I will believe, and when a truth surpasses numeration I will take to admiration. When David spoke of his enemies, he said they were more in number than the hairs of his head; he had, therefore, some idea of their number, and found a figure suitable to set it out; but, in the case of the Lord&#39;s covenant mercies, he declares, &quot;I know not the number,&quot; and does not venture upon any sort of comparison. To creatures belong number and limit, to God and his grace there is neither. We may, therefore, continue to tell out his great salvation all day long, for the theme is utterly inexhaustible.</p>

Let those who will cry up man&#39;s natural innocence, the dignity of the race, the purity of philosophers, the loveliness of untutored savages, the power of sacraments, and the infallibility of pontiffs; this is the true believer&#39;s immovable resolve: &quot;I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.&quot; For ever dedicated to thee, my Lord, be this poor, unworthy tongue, whose glory it shall be to glorify thee.</span></p>

A sacred conservatism is much needed in these days, when men are giving up old lights for new. We mean both to learn and to teach the wonders of redeeming love, till we can discover something nobler or more soul-satisfying; for this reason we hope that our greyheads will be found in the same road as we have trodden, even from our beardless youth.</p>

When our infirmities multiply, we may, with confidence, expect enlarged privileges in the world of grace, to make up for our narrowing range in the field of nature.

Adoration is a fit frame of mind for the believer. When he draws near to God, he enters into a region where everything is surpassingly sublime; miracles of love abound on every hand, and marvels of mingled justice and grace. A traveller among the high Alps often feels overwhelmed with awe, amid their amazing sublimities; much more is this the case when we survey the heights and depths of the mercy and holiness of the Lord. &quot;0 <span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>like </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><i>thee.&quot; </i></p>

Some of the Fathers interpret the Psalm mystically of the church in her old age, and her trials at the end of the world.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&quot;</sup> </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Plain </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Commentary.&#39;&#39; </span></p>

It shows us the soul of the aged saint, darkened by the remembrance of his great transgression, and by the swarms of sorrows with which that sin filled all his later years. But he finds comfort in reverting to the happy days of his childhood, and especially to the irrevocable trust which he was then enabled to repose in God. The thoughts and feelings expressed remind one of those which invest with such a solemn, tender interest the Second Epistle to Timothy, which embalms the dying thoughts of the great apostle. Like Paul, David takes a retrospect of the Lord&#39;s dealings with him from the beginning; and, in effect, declares, with the dying apostle: &quot;lam not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.&quot; 2 Tim. i. 12. Only, there is this notable difference between the two, that while Paul gathered confirmation of his faith from the experience of a thirty years&#39; walk with his Lord, David&#39;s experience stretched over more than twice so many years; for it began with his childhood.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Binnie. </span></p>

The reply to this felt difficulty is, that these expressions are used by him in sympathy with his members, and in his own case denote the state equivalent to age. <span style='font-style:italic;'>His </span>old age was, ere he reached three aud thirty years, as John viii. 57 is supposed to imply: for &quot;Worn-out men live fast.&quot; Barclay seems to give the right sense in the following lines :&#8212;</p>

But this Psalm shows us, that in effect he did pass through that stage of our sojourning, worn, out and wasted in bodily frame and feeling, by living so much in so short a time. The aged members of his church may find his sweet sympathy breathed out in Isaiah xlvi. 3, 4; and, here they may almost see him learning the lesson in a human way, as he bends under the weight of our frailties. For this reason, among others, this Psalm was specially prized by Robert Blair, one of our godly forefathers.

No artist suffers confusion, if he has never shared the good opinion of his fellow men. To no sick man can it be said, Physician, heal thyself, if his reputation for medical skill has never stood high. So of those, it cannot be said, They hoped in God, let him save them if he will have them, of whom it was never remarked that they placed any hope in God.
