It utterly destroys all the beauty, all the tenderness and depth of feeling in the opening portion, if we suppose that the people are introduced speaking in the first person. The allusions to the national history may indeed show that the season was a season of national distress, and that the sweet singer was himself bowed down by the burden of the time, and oppressed by woes which he had no power to alleviate; but it is his own sorrow, not the sorrow of others under which he sighs, and of which he has left the pathetic record.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stewart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Perowne. </span></p>

He says that he did not, as many do, out of their impatience of grief or murmuring, either accuse God of cruelty or tyranny, or utter blasphemous words by which dishonor might fall upon God, or by indulging in sorrow and distrust hasten his own destruction, or fill the air with vain complainings, but fled straight to God and to him unburdened his sorrow, and sought that he would not shut him out from that grace which he bountifully offers to all.

He wrote this Psalm to instruct, caution, and warn us. Observe, they who are entitled to all comfort, often through their own folly, enjoy the least. The Lord&#39;s people are often their own tormentors, they put away the cup of comfort from them, and say they are unworthy of it</span></p>

They were strong in reasoning against their own souls, and resolved against everything that might be a comfort and support unto them. They have been much set against all ordinances and religious services; they have cast off holy duties themselves, and peremptorily refused to join with others in them ; yea, they have, out of a sense of sin and wrath, which hath laid hard upon them, refused the necessary comforts of this life, even to the overthrow of natural life, and yet out of this horrible pit, this hell upon earth, hath God delivered their souls, and given them such manifestations of his grace and favour, that they would not exchange them for a thousand worlds. O despairing souls, you see that others, whose conditions have been as bad if not worse than yours, have obtained mercy. God hath turned their hell into a heaven ; he hath remembered them in their low estate; he hath pacified their raging consciences, and quieted their distracted souls; he hath wiped all tears from their eyes; and he hath been a well-spring of life unto their hearts. Therefore be not discouraged, O despairing souls, but look up to the mercyseat.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Brooks. </span></p>

It will be painful to think of him as Lawgiver; for such thoughts will remind us that we have broken his law. It will be painful to think of his holiness; for if he is holy, he must hate our sins, and be angry with us as sinners :&#8212;of his justice and truth, for these perfections make it necessary that he should fulfil his threatenings and punish us for our sins. It will be painful to think of his omniscience&#8212;for this perfection makes him acquainted with our most secret offences, and renders it impossible to conceal them from his view; of his omnipresence&#8212;for the constant presence of an invisible witness must be disagreeable to those who wish to indulge their sinful propensities. It will be painful to think of his power&#8212;for it enables him to restrain or destroy, as he pleases: of his sovereignty, for sinners always hate to see themselves in the hands of a sovereign God : of his eternity and immutability&#8212;for from his possessing these perfections it follows that he will never alter the threatenings which he has denounced against sinners, and that he will always live to execute them. It will be painful to think of him as judge; for we shall feel, that as sinners, we have no reason to expect a favourable sentence from his lips. It will even be painful to think of the perfect goodness and excellence of his character; for his goodness leaves us without excuse in rebelling against him, and makes our dis appear exceeding sinful.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Edward </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Payson. </span></p>

Little griefs, as it is often said, are uttered, great ones strike us dumb. In great troubles and affrights the spirit fails the exterior members, and flows back to its fountain; the limbs stand motionless, the whole body trembles, the eyes remain fixed, and the tongue forgets its office. Hence it is that Niobe was represented by the poets as turned into a stone. The history of Psammenitus also, in Herodotus, is well known, how over the misfortunes of his children he s:it silent and overwhelmed, but when he saw his friend&#39;s calamities he bewailed them with bitter tears.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Mollerus. </span></p>

It is with us in our desertions as with a man that gets a slight hurt: at first he walks up and down, but not looking betimes to prevent a growing mischief, the neglected wound begins to fester, or to gangrene, and brings him to greater pain and loss. So it is with us many times in our spiritual sadness; when we are first troubled, we pray and pour out our souls before the Lord; but afterwards the waters of our grief drown our cries and we are so overwhelmed, that if we might have all the world we cannot pray, or at least we can find no enlargement, no life, no pleasure in our prayers ; and God himself seems to take no delight in them, and that makes us more sad, Psalm xxii. 1. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Timothy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Rogers </span>(1660&#8212;1729), in <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Discourse </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Trouble </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mind, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Disease </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Melancholy.&quot; </span></p>

To men who have always lived upon land, when first they set to sea, the winds, waves, and storms are exceeding terrible; but when they are a little beaten with the experience of tempests, their fears do change into resolution and courage.

known brighter days. He that lifted me up, has cast me down, and he can raise me up again.&quot; Sometimes this reflection, indeed, adds a poignancy to our distress, as it did to David&#39;s trouble, Ps. xlii. <span style='font-style:italic;'>i. </span>Yet it will bear a better improvement, which he seems to make of it; verse 11, and so Job, (ii. 10.) <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>receive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>receive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evil?&quot; </span>And his case shows that after the most sweeping calamities the Lord can again give things a turn in favour of them that hope in him. Therefore, present troubles should not make us forget former comforts, especially as the former so much exceeded our deserts, and the present afflictions fall so short of our demerits. Or, (2) the text may mean, &quot; I will remember how I have been enabled to sing in the former nights of affliction.&quot; And surely it is especially seasonable to remember supports and consolations granted under preceding distresses. Elihu complained (Job xxxv. 10), &quot;There is none that saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night.&quot; David comforted himself with the thought, &quot; Though deep calleth unto deep, yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me.&quot; Ps. xlii. 8.</span></p>

And cannot many of you, my brethren, in like manner, remember the supports and consolations you have enjoyed in former difficulties, and how the Lord turned the shadow of death into morning? And ought you not to trust to him that hath delivered, that he will yet deliver? He that hath delivered in six troubles, will not forsake you in seven. The &quot;clouds may return after the rain;&quot; but not a drop can fall without the leave of him, who rides on the heavens for your help, and in his excellency on the sky.

Surely you have found that the Lord can clear the darkest skies. &quot;Light is sown for the righteous.&quot; and ere long you shall see an eternal day.

He who is the God of this salvation, and the Author of the promise, will prepare his own way for the doing of his own work, so that &quot; every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill brought low.&quot; Luke iii. 5. Though the valleys be so deep that we cannot see the bottom, and the mountains so high that we cannot see the tops of them, yet God knows how to raise the one and level the other; Isai.

See Rom. iii. 3. Cast not away your confidence because God defers his performances. Though providences a cross, though they move backwards and forwards, you have a sure and faithful word to rely upon. Promises, though they be for a time seemingly delayed, cannot be finally frustrated. Dare not to harbour such a thought within yourselves. The being of God may as well fail as the promise of God.

What shall I do for my mother! Oh, my mother, my mother, what shall I do for my mother! And it may be the mother stands behind the back of the child, only she hides herself, to try the affection of the child: so the poor soul cries after God, and complains, Oh, my Father! my Father! Where is my heavenly Father? Hath he forgotten to be gracious? Hath he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure? when, (all the while), God is nearer than they think for, shining upon them in &quot; a spirit of grace and supplications,&quot; with sighs and &quot;groans that cannot be uttered.&quot; Thus the gracious woman, Mary Magdalene, she seeks after Christ, she enquires, she cries after him, and weeps: My dear Saviour, my dear Lord and Master, he is &quot;taken out of the sepulchre, and I know not where they have laid him!&quot; Thus she complains to the disciples, and thus she complains to the angels, when Christ stood at her very back and overheard all: nay, when she turned her about and saw him, yet at first she did not know him; nay, when he spoke to her and she to him, yet she knew him not, but thought he had been the gardener, John xx. 15. Thus is it with many a gracious soul ; though God speaks home to their hearts in his Word, and they speak to him by prayer, and they cannot say but the Spirit &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>helps </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>infirmities</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>;&quot; </span>yet they complain for want of his presence, as if there were nothing of God in them.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Matthew </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Isiwrence. </span></p>

I consider the whole as a beautiful metaphor. The author considers himself as in distress, like a woman in travail; and like her, hopes soon to have his sorrow turned to joy.

I shall not trouble you with them all at this present time, but only take notice of two of them, which I conceive are the principal and most comprehensive; the one is of our oldest English translation, and the other of our last and newest; the former reads the words thus: <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>l</sup>&#39;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>right </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Most </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>High </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>change </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>this.&quot; </span>The latter reads the words thus, as we have it now before us, &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>remember </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>years,&quot; </span>etc. The main ground of this variation is the different exposition of the Hebrew word <span style='font-style:italic;'>shenoth, </span>which may be translated either <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>change, </span>from the <span style='font-style:italic;'>verb </span>in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>infini</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mood, </span>or else may be translated <span style='font-style:italic;'>years, </span>from the <span style='font-style:italic;'>noun </span>in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>plural </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>number. </span>This hath given the occasion to this difference and variety of translation, but the sense is very good and agreeable which way soever we take it&#8212;</p>

Some promises have their day of payment here, and others we must stay to receive in heaven. Now the payment which God makes of some promises here, is an earnest given to our faith that the others also shall be faithfully discharged when their date expires; as every judgment inflicted here on the wicked is sent as a pledge of that wrath the full sum whereof God will make up in hell.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

I am rather inclined to refer it to heaven, conceiving the meaning to be, that the ways of God rise high above the world, so that if we are truly desirous to know them, we must ascend above all heavens. Although the works of God are in part manifest to us, yet all our knowledge of them comes far short of their immeasurable height. Besides, it is to be observed, that none enjoy the least taste of his works but those who by faith rise up to heaven. And yet. the utmost point to which we can ever attain is, to contemplate with admiration and reverence the hidden wisdom and power of God, which, while they shine forth in his works, yet far surpass the limited powers of our understanding.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

First of all, God&#39;s way is in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>sanctuary, </span>where all is <span style='font-style:italic;'>light, </span>all is <span style='font-style:italic;'>clear. </span>There is no mistake there. There is nothing, in the least degree, that is a harass to the spirit. On the contrary, it is when the poor, troubled one enters into the sanctuary, and views things there in the light of God, that he sees the end of all else&#8212;everything that is entangled, the end of which he cannot find on the earth. But not only is God&#39;s way in the sanctuary (and when we are there, all is bright and happy) ; but God&#39;s way is in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;sea.</span>&quot; He walks <span style='font-style:italic;'>where </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cannot </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>always </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trace </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><i>footsteps. </i>God moves mysteriously by times, as we all know. There are ways of God which are purposely to try us. I need not say that it is not at all as if God had pleasure in our perplexities. Nor is it as if we had no sanctuary to draw near to, where we can rise above it. But, still, there is great deal in the ways of God that must be left entirely in his own hands. The way of God is thus not only in the sanctuary, but also in the sea. And yet, what we find even in connection with his footsteps being in the sea is, &quot;Thou leddest thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.&quot; That was through the sea; afterwards, it was through the wilderness. But it had been through the sea. The beginnings of the ways of God with his people were there ; because, from first to last, God must be the confidence of the saint. It may be an early lesson of his soul, but it never ceases to be the thing to learn. How happy to know that, while the sanctuary is open to us, yet God himself is nearer still&#8212;and to him we are brought * now. As it is said (1 Pet. iii.), &quot;Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God.&quot; This is a most precious thing; because there we are in the sanctuary at once, and brought to God himself. And I am bold to say, that heaven itself would be but a small matter if it were not to God that we are brought. It is better than any freedom from trial&#8212;better than any blessing, to be in the presence of the One we belong to; who is himself the source of all blessing and joy. That we are brought to him now is infinitely precious. There we are in the sanctuary brought to God. But, still, there are other ways of God outside the sanctuary&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sea.&quot; </span>And there we often find ourselves at a loss. If we are occupied with the sea itself, and with trying to scan God&#39;s footsteps there, then <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>known.&quot; </span>But confidence in God himself is always the strength of faith. May the Lord grant us increasing simplicity and quietness in the midst of all that we pass through, for his name&#39;s sake.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>From </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>New </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><i>Old.&quot; </i>1865.</p>

First, that the best people that be are no better able to resist temptation, than the simple sheep is able to withstand the brier that catcheth him. The next, that man is of no more ability to beware of temptations, than the poor sheep is to avoid the brier, being preserved only by the diligence of the shepherd. The third, that as the shepherd is careful of his entangled and bricred sheep, so is God of his afflicted faithful. And the fourth is, that the people of Israel could take no harm of the water, because they entered the sea at God&#39;s commandment. Whereof we learn, that no danger can hurt when God doth command us to enter into it; and all dangers overcome us if we choose them ourselves, besides God&#39;s commandment; as Peter, when he went at God&#39;s commandment upon the water, took no hurt; but when he entered into the bishop&#39;s house upon his own presumption, was overcome and denied Christ. The Israehtes, when they fought at God&#39;s commandment, the peril was nothing; but when they would do it of their own heads, they perished: so that we are bound to attend upon God&#39;s commandment, and then no danger shall destroy us, though it pains us. The other doctrine is in this, that God used the ministry of Moses and Aaron in the deliverance of his people, who did command them to do nothing but that the Lord did first bid. Whereof we learn that such as be ministers appointed of God, and do nothing but as God</p>

Great was the power of these two men; nevertheless neither of them was the shepherd of the sheep, but each was a servant to the one and only true shepherd, to whom the sheep exclusively belonged. Nor yet was either the leader of the sheep, but the shepherd himself was present and led his own flock, to whom these two acted as servants. There are therefore three things to be learned from this passage. First, the sheep do not belong to the servants, but to the true shepherd. Secondly, the true shepherd is the leader of his own sheep. Thirdly, the office of Moses and Aaron was to attend to this duty, that the Lord&#39;s sheep should be properly led and pastured. So Christ himself leads the sheep, his own sheep, and for this work he employs the ministry of his servants.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Musculus. </span></p>
