We are at this day, as readers of the sacred records, bound to study them deeply, exploring their meaning, and labouring to practise their teaching. As the officer of an army commences his drill by calling for &quot; Attention,&quot; even so every trained soldier of Christ is called upon to give ear to his words. Men lend their ears to music, how much more then should they listen to the harmonies of the gospel; they sit enthralled in the presence of an orator, how much rather should they yield to the eloquence of heaven.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA433.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.448.1.1.box.185.560.1301.709.q.60'>2. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>open </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mouth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><i>parable.&quot; </i>Analogies are not only to be imagined, but are intended by God to be traced between the story of Israel and the lives of believers. Israel was ordained to be a type; the tribes and their marchings are living allegories traced by the hand of an all-wise providence. Unspiritual persons may sneer about fancies and mysticisms, but Paul spoke well when he said &quot; which things are an allegory,&quot; and Asaph in the present case spake to the point when he called his narrative &quot; a parable.&quot; That such was his meaning is clear from the quotation, &quot;All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.&quot;&#8212;Matthew xiii. 34, 35. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>utter </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dark </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sayings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>old;&quot;</span>&#8212;enigmas of antiquity, riddles of yore. The mind of the poet-prophet was so full of ancient lore that he poured it forth in a copious stream of song, while beneath the gushing flood lay pearls and gems of spiritual truth, capable of enriching those who could dive into the depths and bring them up. The letter of this song is precious, but the inner sense is beyond all price. Whereas the first verse called for attention, the second justifies the demand by hinting that the outer sense conceals an inner and hidden meaning, which only the thoughtful will be able to perceive.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA433.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.448.1.2.box.139.1269.1344.567.q.60'>3. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>known, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fathers </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>told </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us.&quot; </span>. Tradition was of the utmost service to the people of God in the olden time, before the more sure word of prophecy had become complete and generally accessible. The receipt of truth from the lips of others laid the instructed believer under solemn obligation to pass on the truth to the next generation. Truth, endeared to us by its fond associations with godly parents and venerable friends, deserves of us our best exertions to preserve and propagate it. Our fathers told us, we heard them, and we know personally what they taught; it remains for us in our turn to hand it on. Blessed be God we have now the less mutable testimony of written revelation, but this by no means lessens our obligation to instruct our children in divine truth by word of mouth: rather, with such a gracious help, we ought to teach them far more fully the things of God. Dr. Doddridge owed much to the Dutch tiles and his mother&#39;s explanations of the Bible narratives. The more of parental teaching the better; ministers and Sabbath-school teachers were never meant to be substitutes for mothers&#39; tears and fathers&#39; prayers.</p>

It is the duty of the church of God to maintain, in fullest vigour, every agency intended for the religious education of the young; to them we must look for the church of the future, and as we sow towards them so shall we reap. Children are to be taught to magnify the Lord; they ought to be well informed as to his wonderful doings in ages past, and should be made to know &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><i>wonder </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>ful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>done.&quot; </span>The best education is education in the best things.

flavoured with grace. Every satchel should have a Bible in it. The world may teach secular knowledge alone, &#39;tis all she has a heart to know, but the church must not deal so with her offspring; she should look well to every Timothy, and see to it that from a child he knows the Holy Scriptures. Around the fire-side fathers should repeat not only the Bible records, but the deeds of the martyrs and reformers, and moreover the dealings of the Lord with themselves both in providence and grace. We dare not follow the vain and vicious traditions of the apostate church of Rome, neither would we compare the fallible record of the best human memories with the infallible written word, yet would we fain see oral tradition practised by every Christian in his family, and children taught cheerfully by word of mouth by their own mothers and fathers, as well as by the printed pages of what they too often regard as dull, dry task books. What happy hours and pleasant evenings have children had at their parents&#39; knees as they have listened to some &quot; sweet story of old.&quot; Reader, if you have children, mind you do not fail in this duty.</span></p>

It is common in some regions for men to count their family custom as the very best rule; but disobedience is not to be excused because it is hereditary. The leprosy was none the less loathsome because it had been long in the family.

upon them. It was, indeed, needful that their descendants should be warned, so that they might not blindly imitate them. How blessed would it be if each age improved upon its predecessor; but, alas! it is to be feared that decline is more general than progress, and too often the heirs of true saints are far more rebellious than even their fathers were in their unregeneracy. May the reading of this patriotic and divine song move many to labour after the elevation of themselves and their posterity.</span></p>

It was bad enough to mistrust their God for necessaries, but to revolt against him in a greedy rage for superfluities was far worse. Ever is it the nature of the disease of sin to proceed from bad to worse ; men never weary of sinning, but rather increase their speed in the race of iniquity. In the case before us the goodness of God was abused into a reason for greater sin. Had not the Lord been so good they would not have been so bad.

At one time they provoked his jealousy by their hankering after false gods, anon they excited his wrath by their challenges of his power, their slanders against his love, their rebellions against his will. He was all bounty of love, and they all superfluity of naughtiness. They were favoured above all nations, and yet none were more ill-favoured. For them the heavens dropped manna, and they returned murmurs; the rocks gave them rivers, and they replied with floods of wickedness. Herein, as in a mirror, we see ourselves. Israel in the wilderness acted out, as in a drama, all the story of man&#39;s conduct towards his God.</p>

Christ cannot die again, and yet many crucify him afresh, because such would be the legitimate result of their behaviour if its effects were not prevented by other forces.

As if the manna was a mere make-shift, and the flowing rock-stream a temporary expedient, they ask to have a regularly furnished table, such as they had been accustomed to in Egypt.

God is ready to save, combining power with willingness, but rebellious man will not trust his Saviour, and therefore is condemned already. In the text it appears as if all Israel&#39;s other sins were as nothing compared with this; this is the peculiar spot which the Lord points at, the special provocation which angered him. From this let every unbeliever learn to tremble more at his unbelief than at anything else. If he be no fornicator, or thief, or liar, let him reflect that it is quite enough to condemn him that he trusts not in God&#39;s salvation.</p>

None live so fruitlessly and so wretchedly as those who allow sense and sight to override faith, and their reason and appetite to domineer over their fear of God. Our days go fast enough according to the ordinary lapse of time, but the Lord can make them rust away at a bitterer rate, till we feel as if sorrow actually ate out the heart of our life, and like a canker devoured our existence. Such was the punishment of rebellious Israel, the Lord grant it may not bo ours.</p>

If you beat a tiger with many stripes you cannot turn him into a sheep. The devil cannot be whipped out of human nature, though another devil, namely, hypocrisy may be whipped into it.

This teaches us to place small reliance upon professions of repentance made by dying men, or upon such even in others when the basis is evidently slavish fear, and nothing more. Any thief will whine out repentance if he thinks the judge will thereby be moved to let him go scot free.</p>

One day they gave their gold to build a tabernacle for Jehovah, and the next they plucked off their ear-rings to make a golden calf. Surely the heart is a chameleon. Proteus had not so many changes.

How great is that God who thus by the minute can crush the magnificent. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>frogs, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>destroyed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them.&#39;&#39; </span>These creatures swarmed everywhere when they were alive, until the people felt ready to die at the sight; and when the reptiles died, the heaps of their bodies made the land to stink so foully, that a pestilence was imminent. Thus not only did earth and air send forth armies of horrible life, but the water also added its legions of loathsomeness. It seemed as if the Nile was first made nauseous and then caused to leave its bed altogether, crawling and leaping in the form of frogs. Those who contend with the Almighty, little know what arrows are in his quiver; surprising sin shall be visited with surprising punishment.</span></p>

Mark how the heavens obey their Lord and yield their stores of hail, and note how the fickle weather is equally subservient to the divine will.</p>

Thus does another race often enter into the lot of a former people, and it is sad indeed when the change which judgment decrees does not turn out to be much for the better, because the incomers inherit the evils as well as the goods of the ejected. Such a case of judicial visitation ought to have had a salutary influence upon the tribes; but, alas, they were incorrigible, and would not learn even from examples so near at home and so terribly suggestive.</span></p>

They left their nomadic habits, but not their tendencies to wander from their God. Though every divine promise had been fulfilled to the letter, and the land flowing with milk and honey wrfs actually their own, yet they tried the Lord again with unbelief, and provoked him with other sins. He is not only high and glorious, but most High, yea <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span>most High, the only being who deserves to be so highly had in honour; yet, instead of honouring him, Israel grieved him with rebellion. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>kept </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>testi</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>monies.&quot; </span>They were true to nothing but hereditary treachery; steadfast in nothing but in falsehood. They knew his truth and forgot it, his will and disobeyed it, his grace and perverted it to an occasion for greater transgression. Reader, dost thou need a looking-glass? See here is one which suits the present expositor well ; does it not also reflect thine image?</p>

They were a new generation, but not a new nation&#8212;another race yet not another. Evil propensities are transmitted; the birth follows the progenitor ; the wild ass breeds wild asses; the children of the raven fly to the carrion. Human nature does not improve, the new editions contain all the errata of the first, and sometimes fresh errors are imported. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>were </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>turned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>aside </span><i>like </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>deceitful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bow,&#39;&#39; </span>which not only fails to send the arrow towards the mark in a direct line, but springs back to the archer&#39;s hurt, and perhaps sends the shaft among his friends to their serious jeopardy. Israel boasted of the bow as the national weapon, they sang the song of^ the bow, and hence a deceitful bow is made to be the type and symbol of their own unsteadfastness; God can make men&#39;s glory the very ensign of their shame, he draws a bar sinister across the escutcheon of traitors.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA448.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.463.1.3.box.264.1511.1302.805.q.60'>58. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>provoked </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anger </span><i>with </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>high </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>places.&#39;&#39; </span>This was their first error &#8212;will-worship, or the worship of God, otherwise than according to his command. Many think lightly of this, but indeed it is no mean sin; and its tendencies to further offence are very powerful. The Lord would have his holy place remain as the only spot for sacrifice; and Israel, in wilful rebellion, (no doubt glossed over by the plea of great devotion,) determined to have many altars upon many hills. If they might have but one God, they insisted upon it that they would not ba restricted to one sacred place of sacrifice. How much of the worship of the present day is neither, more nor less than sheer willworship! Nobody dare plead a divine appointment for a tithe of the offices, festivals, ceremonies, and observances of certain churches. Doubtless God, so far from being honoured by worship which he has not commanded, is greatly angered at it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moved </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>jealousy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>graven </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>images.&quot; </span>This was but one more step ; they manufactured symbols of the invisible God, for they lusted after something tangible and visible to which they could shew reverence. This also is the crying sin of modern times. Do we not hear and see superstition abounding. Images, pictures, crucifixes, and a host of visible things are had in religious honour, and worst of all men now-a-days worship what they eat, and call that a God which passes into their belly, and thence into baser places still. Surely the Lord is very patient, or he would visit the earth for this worst and basest of idolatry. He is a jealous God, and abhors to see himself dishonoured by any form of representation which can come from man&#39;s hands.</p>
