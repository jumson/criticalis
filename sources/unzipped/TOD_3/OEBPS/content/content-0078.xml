The translation from his mother&#39;s womb to the light of day is to him an object of praise. (Psalm i xxii. 9, 10.) And, really, is not the preservation of the embryo, in its narrow confines, a miracle? is it not a pledge, simultaneously with man&#39;s growing into being, of our after experience in life, that we have a God &quot; who bringeth us out of death to light?&quot; (Psalm lxviii. 20.) Is not the reason of our finding so little to praise, to be sought in our having no eyes for his daily miracles? The psalmist <span style='font-style:italic;'>has </span>eyes for the daily miracles of the Lord ; and, therefore, his mouth is daily full of the praise of the Lord.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Augustus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>F. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tholuek. </span></p>

He not only celebrates the goodness of God, which he had experienced from his childhood, but, also, those proofs of it which he had received previous to his birth. An almost similar confession is contained in Psalm xxii. 9, 10, by which is magnified the wonderful power and inestimable goodness of God in the generation of men, the way and manner of which would be altogether incredible, were it not a fact with which we are quite familiar. If we are astonished at that part of the history of the flood, in which Moses declares (Genesis viii. 13), that Noah and his household lived ten months amidst the offensive nuisance produced by so many living creatures, when he could not draw the breath of life, have we not equal reason to marvel that the infant, shut up within its mother&#39;s womb, can live in such a condition as would suffocate the strongest man in half an hour? But we thus see how little account we make of the miracles which God works, in consequence of our familiarity with them. The Spirit, therefore, justly rebukes this ingratitude, by commending to our consideration this memorable instance of the grace of God which is exhibited in our birth and generation. When we are born into the world, although the mother do her office, and the midwife may be present with her, and many others may lend their help, yet did not God, putting, so to speak, his hand under us, receive us into his bosom, what would become of us? and what hope would there be of the continuance of our life? Yea, rather, were it not for this, our very birth would be an entrance into a thousand deaths. God, therefore, is with the highest propriety said <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>take </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mother&#39;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bowels. </span>To this corresponds the concluding part of the verse, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><i>continually </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee</span>;&quot; by which the psalmist means that he had been furnished with matter for praising God without intermission.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

Some interpreters are of opinion, that it is here taken in the most favourable sense, and that the psalmist represents himself as considered, by the many, as a <span style='font-style:italic;'>prodigy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>goueiness. </span>But the whole tenor of the Psalm is against this meaning; which is not badly expressed by Green: &quot;I am become a gazing-stock to the multitude.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Alexander </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Geddes. </span>1737&#8212;1802.</p>

This may arise from the circumstance of his conversion dating at a late period of his life, when his long continuance in a state of impenitence seemed to render it<a id='GBS.PA306.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.321.1.0.box.261.282.1280.780.q.60'>
almost certain that he would persist in it to the last. It is, indeed, a wonder to see any human being&#39;s course entirely altered at a late period, and to observe him afterwards moving in a totally different direction, influenced by different principles. Or, to take the instance of another convert, the character he is enabled to sustain, founded upon his great change, is in such marked and continued contrast to his former habits of life as to render it difficult to recognise in the Christian of to-day the sinner of yesterday. &quot;Is Saul also among the prophets?&quot; Or, in yet another example, the means divinely employed to effect conversion may be, apparently, so disproportionate to the magnitude of the result, as to place the result itself under suspicion and doubt. Every godly man, like Ananias of old, may hesitate to admit into his society the persecutor or the profligate of unhappy notoriety, except upon clearly discerning that he has become a new creature in Christ Jesus, and that old evil habits have passed away. At the same time, his former ungodly associates are mortified at is renunciation of fellowship with them, and are malicious enough to promulgate false reports concerning his character and motives. &quot;They think it strange,&quot; says the apostle, &quot;that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.&quot; Yet to such a convert his God is a sun and shield&#39;s shield from the shafts of cruel slander, and a refuge to him from all storms of persecution. In all similar cases the language of the psalmist becomes particularly appropriate: &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wonder </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>many</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>but </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strong </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>refuge.&quot; </span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Leifchild. </span></span></p>

He did arrest attention; he did excite &quot;uwirfer;&quot; but it was not the wonder of admiration. A few, whose eyes God had opened, saw, indeed, in some measure, the real grandeur there was amid all this apparent meanness. They &quot; beheld his glory&#8212;the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father;&quot; a glory that bedimraed all created lustre. But the great body of those who beheld him were &quot;astonished&quot; at him. His external appearance, especially when contrasted with his claim to Messiahship, shocked them. The Galilean peasant&#8212;the Nazarene carpenter&#8212;the son of Joseph, claiming God for his own Father,&#8212;declaring himself the &quot; bread of life,&quot; and &quot;the light of the world,&quot; and asserting that the destinies of eternity hung on the reception or rejection of him and his message; all this excited a mingled emotion of amazement and indignation, scorn and horror, in the bosom of the great majority of his countrymen. He was &quot;a <span style='font-style:italic;'>wonder,&#39;&#39; </span>a prodigy unto many. A mixture of pity and contempt, disgust and wonder, seems to have stirred the stern bosom of the Roman governor, when he brought him out wearing the robe of mock royalty and the torturing crown, and exclaimed, &quot; Behold the man.&quot; Even his friends were confounded, though their astonishment bore a different character. The closing scene, notwithstanding what appear to us very plain forewarning!, appears to have come on them like a thunderbolt. They were overwhelmed with amazement, as well as with sorrow. What blank astonishment sat on their countenances when he made the announcement, &quot;Verily I say unto you, one of you shall betray me!&quot; How must their amazement have risen at the successive scenes of Gethsemane, and the hall of the high priest, and the court of Pilate, till at last they saw him, in whom they trusted that he should redeem Israel, nailed to a cross like a felonious slave&#8212;execrated of man, and deserted of God!

He teaches his child, that he may teach him; shows him his folly, that he may make him wise; strips him of his vain confidence, that he may give him strength ; makes him know that he is nothing, that he may show him that he has all in the Lord&#8212;in Jesus his Beloved one.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Harrington </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Evans. </span></p>
