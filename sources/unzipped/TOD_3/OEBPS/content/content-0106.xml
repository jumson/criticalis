Ah! but a gracious soul cries out, Lord, do but take away my sins, and it will satisfy me and cheer me, though thou shouldst never take off thy heavy hand.

For instance, look to these in Psalm lxxviii. 34&#8212;37.

Now, if none of the former signs reach to them, nor touch them, then there is no better way left than to search unto the grounds of all they do, and to examine whether it proceeds from true, inward, pure, and constant good-will, yea or no, or self-respects? As now, when we see an ape do many things that a man doth, how do we therefore distinguish those actions in the one and in the other? Why, by the inward principles from whence they spring, by saying that they proceed from reason in the one, but not so in the other. If, therefore, it can be evinced, that all that any man seems to do for God, comes not from good-will to him, it is enough to convince them to be persons unreconciled ; for whereas all outward kindnesses and expressions of friendship proceed not from friend-like dispositions and pure good-will, but altogether from self-respects, it is but feigned flattery, even among men; and when discovered once, it breeds double hatred. And there is much more reason it should do so with God, because he being a God that knows the heart, to flatter him is the greater mockery; for that is it which chiefly provoketh men to hate such as dissemble friendship, because there is mockery joined with it. Now, that God accounteth every one that doth not turn to him out of pure good-will a flatterer is plain by these words in verses 36, 37: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Notwithstanding, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>did </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>but </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flatter </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dealt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>falsely </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><i>cove- </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>nant.&quot; </span>If men&#39;s hearts be not inwardly for God, and with him, as a friend would be to a friend, in their actions he esteems them against him. &quot;Thy heart,&quot; says Peter to Simon Magus, &quot;is not right before the Lord,&quot; Acts viiL 22, and therefore he tells him he was &quot;still in the gall of bitterness.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

Man is flattered when that is ascribed to him which he hath not, or when he is applauded for what he hath, beyond the worth of it. God cannot be flattered thus: he is as much beyond flatterings as he is beyond sufferings. The Jews, then, are said to flatter God, not because they applauded him by fair speeches more than was his due, but because by fair speeches they hoped to prevent what themselves did deserve; or they flattered God with their own promises, not with his praises. They sinned against him, and he slew them; and when the sword found them they sought God, they creeped to him and fawned upon him, they came as with ropes about their necks, confessing they were worthy to die, yet humbly begging for life: and if God would but humbly sheathe his sword and spare them, O what manner of men they would be in all holy conversation and godliness. Thus &quot;they flattered God with their mouth, while their hearts were not right :&quot; they made great shews of repentance and turning to God, but they meant no such thing: this was their flattery. Neither can the Lord be flattered any other way. And as he cannot be flattered by overpraising him, so his person cannot be unduly honoured by over-respecting him, &#8212;<i>Joseph </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl. </span></p>

Because Israel forgot that first deliverance, they went on frowardly in the way of evil. Because a Christian sometimes stops short of the Cross in his spiritual conflicts, he fails to defeat the enemy and remains unfruitful and unhappy, until by some special intervention of the great Restorer, he is again brought, in spirit, to that place where God first met him, and welcomed him in Jesus in the fullness of forgiveness and of peace. No intermediate experience, how truthful soever in its character, will meet his case. It is at the cross alone that we regain a thorough right-mindedness about ourselves as well as about God.

Now the Egyptians, and especially their priests, were particularly nice and delicate in their outward habit and rites; and there was nothing which they abhorred more than blood, they seldom admitted any bloody sacrifices; and with the least stain of gore they would have thought themselves deeply polluted. Their affectation of purity was so great that they could not bear to come within contact with a foreigner, or even to handle his clothes; but to touch a dead body was an abomination, and required to be immediately expiated .... On these accounts the priests, were continually making ablutions. There were four stated times, twice in the day, and as often in the night, at which they were all obliged to bathe themselves.

the natural phenomena of Egypt, its home, translates also <span style='font-style:italic;'>nicvidet </span>(musquito gnats); which Philo, likewise an Egyptian, describes thus: &quot;It is an insect although of very small size, yet of a most troublesome nature; for it hurts not only the surface, causing intolerable and protracted itching, but penetrates also into the interior through the ears and noses. It flies even into the eyes of those who do not guard themselves, and produces pain.&quot; All which qualities are perfectly applicable to gnats.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kalisch. </span></span></p>

The beetle, which is almost everywhere a nuisance, is particularly abundant and offensive in Egypt, and all the circumstances which the Scriptures in different places intimates concerning the <span style='font-style:italic;'>arob, </span>applies with much accuracy to this species. It devours everything that comes in its way, even clothes, books, and plants, and does not hesitate to inflict severe bites on men. If also we conceive that one object of these plagues was to chasten the Egyptians through their own idols, there is no creature of its class which could be more fitly employed than this insect. What precise place it filled in the religious system of that remarkable people has never, we believe, been exactly determined ; but that it occupied a conspicuous place among their sacred creatures seems to be evinced by the fact, that there is scarcely any figure which occurs more frequently in Egyptian sculpture and painting.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bush. </span></p>

them, and themselves unclean by leaping upon them; which deprived them of rest by getting on their beds, and of food by crawling into their ovens and upon the dough in the kncading-troughs. And, as if to make the visitation still worse, when the plague was removed, the frogs died in the places into which they had intruded, so that the Egyptians were obliged to clear their houses of the dead carcases, and to pile them up in heaps, to be dried by the sun, or eaten by birds and other scavengers of the East. As to the species of frog which thus invaded the houses of the Egyptians, there is no doubt whatever. It can be but the <span style='font-style:italic;'>green, </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>edible </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>frog </span><i>(Rana </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>esculenta), </span>which is so well known for the delicacy of its flesh. This is believed to be the only aquatic frog of Egypt, and therefore must be the species which came out of the river into the houses. Both in Egypt and Palestine it exists in very great numbers, swarming in every marshy place, and inhabiting the pools in such numbers that the water can scarcely be seen for the frogs. Thus the multitudes of the frogs which invaded the Egyptians was no matter of wonder, the only miraculous element being that the reptiles were simultaneously directed to the houses, and their simultaneous death when the plague was taken away.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wood. </span></span></p>

The same thing hoppcneth when the string of the bow is naughty, and breaks when the arrow is drawn. This is no less than a divine Scripture allegory. Behold, such a fallacious, warping, and rotten bow is man&#39;s deceitful heart ; his purposes and promises are the arrows that he puts upon the string, the mark he aim) at is repentance, to the which (in affliction especially) he looketh with an accurate and intent eye, as though he would repent indeed; but, alas! his heart deceives him, as being unsound in God&#39;s statutes, Psalm cxix. 80; and hence it is that his promises and pretences do fall at his foot, or vanish in the air as smoke.

At first the cry of wailing, which always follows a death in ordinary circumstances, is loud and frequent: but such cries do not increase, but subside, with the increase of the calamity and desolation. Death becomes a familiar object in every house; and every re absorbed in his own losses, has little sympathy to spare for others. Hence the loudest lamentations cease to be noticed, or to draw condoling friends to the house of mourning; and therefore, as well as from the stupefaction of feeling which scenes of continued horror never fail to produce, a new death is received in silence, or only with sighs and tears. In fact, all the usual observances are suspended. The dead are carried out and buried without mourning ceremonies, and without the presence of surviving friends, by men who make it an employment to take away the dead on the backs of mules or asses, from the homes they leave desolate.

These are not to be understood as to an universal and absolute forgetting and sleep of providence; for God hath not his vacation time : he still holds the reins of government in his hand, all the world over. Neither do they infer an absolute cessation of providence in reference to that object-matter which the Lord to our apprehension seems to forget, and lies dormant; for there is a promoting-work of providence, which we see not, and are not so sensible of for the present, as hath been shewed. Besides, such forgetting and sleep of providence, as it is such, bespeaks the beauty of providence in the way of bringing things to pass. It is so far from inferring an <span style='font-style:italic;'>interregnum, </span>or letting fall the sceptre of government, as that it is a glorious demonstration that God orders matters, and that wisely, whilst he seems to forget, and be as one asleep.

This is distinct from the former; for an indefinite is not knowing whom he pitched it upon. Now, as he knew whom he pitched upon, so he hath pitched but upon some, not on every one. ... If God would love, it was fit he should be free. It is a strange thing that you will not allow God that which kings and princes have the prerogative of, and you will allow it them. They will have favourites whom they will love, and will not love others; and yet men will not allow God that liberty, but he must either love all mankind, or he must be cruel and unjust. The specialness of his love greateneth it, endeareth it to us. You shall find almost all along the Bible, that when God would express his love, he doth it with a speciality to his own elect, which he illustrates by the contrary done to others. . . . And you shall find frequently in the Scripture, when he mentioneth his choice of some persons, he holdeth up likewise on purpose his refusing of others. . . .

He speaks of the times of the judges. The rejection of the ten tribes began to show itself soon; he says, he refused the tabernacle of Ephraim, but he chose Judah. After Solomon&#39;s time, they fell to worshipping of calves (let me tell you, it is the declining of election that undoes a nation, when election grows low, in creases in an age), till at last the ten tribes were cast off, as they are at this day ; but the tribe of Judah had election among them. . . .</p>

But Ephraim, for their sinning against that worship, forfeited and lost it, and should therefore have the keeping of it no longer, no, not for ever any more; but Judah had it at Bethlehem, till at last it was fixedly seated in Sion, as &quot; the earth is established &quot; (ver. 69) ; and this for no other reason than that he had loved them, and out of love had chosen them (ver. 67&#8212;69).
