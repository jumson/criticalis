<span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>seek </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.<sup>&quot;</sup> </span>Possession breeds desire. Full assurance is no hindrance to diligence, but is the mainspring of it. How can I seek another man&#39;s God? but it is with ardent desire that I seek after him whom I know to be my own. Observe the eagerness implied in the time mentioned; he will not wait for noon or the cool eventide; he is up at cockcrowing to meet his God. Communion with God is so sweet that the chill of the morning is forgotten, and the luxury of the couch is despised. The morning is the time for dew and freshness, and the psalmist consecrates it to prayer and devout fellowship. The best of men have been betimes on their knees. The word &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>early&quot; </span>has not only the sense of early in the morning, but that of eagerness, immediateness. He who truly longs for God longs for him now. Holy desires are among the most powerful influences that stir our inner nature; hence the next sentence, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thirtieth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&#39;&#39; </span>Thirst is an insatiable longing after that which is one of the most essential supports of life; there is no reasoning with it. no forgetting it, no despising it, no overcoming it by stoical indifference. Thirst will be heard; the whole man must yield to its power; even thus is it with that divine desire which the grace of God creates in regenerate men; cnly God himself can satisfy the craving of a soul really aroused by the Holy Spirit. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flesh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>longeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee;&quot; </span>by the two words <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;soul&quot; </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;flesh,&quot; </span>he denotes the whole of his being. &quot;The <span style='font-style:italic;'>flesh,&quot; </span>in the New Testament sense of it, never longs after the Lord, but rather it lusteth against the spirit; David only refers to that sympathy which is sometimes created in our bodily frame by vehement emotions of the soul. Our corporeal nature usually tugs in the other direction, but the spirit when ardent can compel it to throw in what power it has upon the other side. When the wilderness caused David weariness, discomfort, and thirst, his flesh cried out in unison with the desire of his soul. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thirsty </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>land, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>where </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>water </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is.&quot; </span>A weary place and a weary heart make the presence of God the more desirable: if there be nothing below and nothing within to cheer, it is a thousand mercies that we may look up and find all we need. How frequently have believers traversed in their experience this &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>dry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><i>thirsty </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>land,&quot; </span>where spiritual joys are things forgotten ! and how truly can they testify that the only true necessity of that country is the near presence of their God! The absence of outward comforts can be borne with serenity when we walk with God ; and the most lavish multiplication of them avails not when he withdraws. Only after God, therefore, let us pant. Let all desires be gathered into one. Seeking first the kingdom of God&#8212;all else shall be added unto us.</span></p>

Often had his heart been gladdened by communion with God in the outward ordinances, and for this great blessing he sighs again; as well he might, for it is the weightiest of all earth&#39;s sorrows for a Christian man to lose the conscious presence of his covenant God. He remembers and mentions the two attributes which had most impressed themselves upon his mind when he had been rapt in adoration in the holy place ; upon these his mind had dwelt in the preceding Psalm, and the savour of that contemplation is evidently upon his heart when in the wilderness: these he desires to behold again in the place of his banishment. It is a precious thought that the divine power and glory are not confined in their manifestation to any places or localities; they are to be heard above the roaring of the sea, seen amid the glare of the tempest, felt in the forest and the prairie, and enjoyed wherever there is a heart that longs and thirsts to behold them. Our misery is that we thirst so little for these sublime things, and so much for the mocking trifles of time and sense. We are in very truth always in a weary land, for this is not our rest; and it is marvellous that believers do not more continuously thirst after their portion far beyond the river where they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; but shall see the face of their God, and his name shall be in their foreheads.

God was enough for him, but nothing short of that would content him. How great a friend is he, the very sight of whom is consolation. Oh, my soul, imitate the psalmist, and let all thy desires ascend towards the highest good; longing here to see God, and having no higher joy even for eternity.</span></p>

Life is dear, but God&#39;s love is dearer. To dwell with God is better than life at its best; life at ease, in a palace, in health, in honour, in wealth, in pleasure; yea, a thousand lives are not equal to the eternal life which abides in Jehovah&#39;s simile. In him we truly live, and move, and have our being; the withdrawal of the light of his countenance is as the shadow of death to us: hence we cannot but long after the Lord&#39;s gracious appearing. Life is to many men a doubtful good: lovingkindness is an unquestioned boon: life is but transient, mercy is everlasting: life is shared in by the lowest animals, but the lovingkindness of the Lord is the peculiar portion of the chosen. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lips </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&quot; </span>Openly, so that thy glory shall be made known, I will tell of thy goodness. Even when our heart is rather desiring than enjoying we should still continue to magnify the Most High, for his love is truly precious ; even if we do not personally, for the time being, happen to be rejoicing in it. We ought not to make our praises of God to depend upon our own personal and present reception of benefits; this would be mere selfishness ; even publicans and sinners have a good word for those whose hands are enriching them with gifts; it is the true believer only who will bless the Lord when he takes away his gifts or hides his face.</p>

While we live we will love. If we see no cause to rejoice in our estate, we shall always have reason for rejoicing in the Lord. If none others bless God, yet his people will ; his very nature, as being the infinitely good God, is it sufficient argument for our praising him as long as we exist. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lift </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><i>name.&quot; </i>For worship the hands were uplifted, as also in joy, in thanksgiving, in labour, in confidence; in all these senses we would lift up our hands in Jehovah&#39;s name alone. No hands need hang down when God draws near in love. The name of Jesus has often made lame men leap as a hart, and it has made sad men clap their hands for joy.</p>

There is in the love of God a richness, a sumptuousness, a fulness of soul-filling joy, comparable to the richest food with which the body can be nourished. The Hebrews were more fond of fat than we are, and their highest idea of festive provision is embodied in the two words, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>marrow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fatness</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>:&quot; </span>a soul hopeful in God and full of his favour is thus represented as feeding upon the best of the best, the dainties of a royal banquet. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mouth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>joyful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lips.&quot; </span>More joy, more praise. When the mouth is full of mercy, it should be also full of thanksgiving. When God gives us the marrow of his love, we must present to him the marrow of our hearts.

He had a feast in the night, and a song in the night. He turned his bedchamber into an oratory, he consecrated his pillow, his praise anticipated the place of which it is written, &quot;There is no night there.&quot; Perhaps the wilderness helped to keep him awake , and if so, all the ages are debtors to it for this delightful hymn. If day&#39;s cares tempt us to forget God, it is well that night&#39;s quiet should lead us to remember him. We see best in the dark if we there see God best. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>meditate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>night </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>watches.&quot; </span>Keeping up sacred worship in my heart as the<a id='GBS.PA136.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.151.1.0.box.227.285.1281.461.q.60'>
priests and Levites celebrated it in the sanctuary. Perhaps David had formerly united with those &quot; who by night stand in the house of the Lord,&quot; and now as he could not be with them in person, he remembers the Hours as they pass, and unites with the choristers in spirit, blessing Jehovah as they did. It may be, moreover, that the king heard the voices of the sentries as they relieved guard, and each time he returned with renewed solemnity to his meditations upon his God. Night is congenial, in its silence and darkness, to a soul which would forget the world, and rise into a higher sphere. Absorption in the most hallowed of all themes makes watches, which else would be weary, glide away all too rapidly; it causes the lonely and hard couch to yield the most delightful repose&#8212;repose more restful than even sleep itself. We read of beds of ivory, but beds of piety are better far. Some revel in the night, but they are not a tithe so happy as those who meditate in God.</span></p>

Donne says of it.: &quot;As the whole Book of Psalms is, <span style='font-style:italic;'>oleum </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>offusun </span>(as the spouse speaks of the name of Christ), an ointment poured out upon all sorts of sores, a cerecloth that supplies all bruises, a balm that searches all wounds; so are there some certain Psalms that are imperial Psalms, that command over all affections, and spread themselves over all occasions&#8212;catholic, universal Psalms, that apply themselves to all necessities. This is one of these; for of those constitutions which are called apostolical, one is that the church should meet every day to sing this Psalm. And, accordingly, St. Chrysostom testifies, &#39;That it was decreed and ordained by the primitive Fathers, that no day should pass without the public singing of this Psalm.&#39; &quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stewart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Perowne. </span></p>

This is the peculiar fountain of consolation which is opened up to the sufferer in the Psalm. The Berleb Bible describes it as a Psalm &quot;which proceeds from a spirit really in earnest. It was the favourite Psalm of M. Schade, the famous preacher in Berlin, which he daily prayed with such earnestness and appropriation to himself, that it was impossible to hear it without emotion if. <span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hengstenberg. </span></p>

And in this Psalm public misfortunes do but force him back upon the central strength of the life of his spirit. For the time his crown, his palace, his honours, the hearts of his people, the love of his child, whom he loved, as we know, with such passing tenderness, are forfeited. The psalmist is alone with God. In his hour of desolation he looks up from the desert to heaven. &quot;0 <span style='font-style:italic;'>God,&quot; </span>he cried, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&quot; </span>In the original language he does not repeat the word which is translated <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&quot;</sup>God.&quot; </span>In <span style='font-style:italic;'>Elohim, </span>the true idea of the<a id='GBS.PA139.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.154.1.0.box.48.290.1349.1311.q.60'>
root is that of awe, while the adjectival form implies permanency. In <span style='font-style:italic;'>Eli, </span>the second word employed, the etymological idea is that of might, strength. We might paraphrase, &quot;O thou Ever-awful One, my Strength, or my StrongGod art thou.&quot; But the second word, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Eli, </span>is in itself nothing less than a separate revelation of an entire aspect of the Being of God. It is, indeed, used as a proper and distinct name of God. The pronominal suffixes for the second and third persons are, as Gesenius has remarked, never once found with this name <span style='font-style:italic;'>El; </span>whereas <span style='font-style:italic;'>Eli, </span>the first person, occurs very frequently in the Psalter alone. We all of us remember it in the words actually uttered by our Lord upon the cross, and which he took from the Syriacised version of Psalm xxii. The word unveils a truth unknown beyond the precincts of revelation. It teaches us that the Almighty and Eternal gives himself in the fulness of his Being to the soul that seeks him. Heathenism, indeed, in its cultus of domestic and local deities, of its penates, of its <span style='font-style:italic;'>Qeol </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cirixupioi, </span>bore witness by these superstitions to the deep yearning of the human heart for the individualizing love of a higher power. To know the true God was to know that such a craving was satisfied. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>GoiV </span>The word represents not a human impression, or desire, or conceit, but an aspect, a truth, a necessity of the divine nature. Man can, indeed, give himself by halves; he can bestow a little of his thoughts, of his heart, of his endeavour, upon his brother man. In other words, man can be imperfect in his acts as he is imperfect and finite in his nature. But when God, the Perfect Being, loves the creature of his hand, he cannot thus divide his love. He must perforce love with the whole directness, and strength, and intensity of his Being; for he is God, and therefore incapable of partial and imperfect action. He must give himself to the single soul with as absolute a completeness as if there were no other being besides it, and, on his side, man knows that this gift of himself by God is thus entire ; and in no narrow spirit of ambitious egotism, but as grasping and representing the literal fact, he cries, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;<sup>l</sup>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gad.&quot; </span>Therefore does this word enter so largely into the composition of Hebrew names. Men loved to dwell upon that wondrous relation of the Creator to their personal life which is so strikingly manifested. Therefore, when God had &quot;so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,&quot; we find St. Paul writing to the Galatians as if his own single soul had been redeemed by the , sacrifice of Calvary: &quot;He loved me, and gave himself for me.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Parry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luldon, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Some </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Words </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>being </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermons </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>University </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><i>Oxford, </i>1863&#8212;1865.&quot;</span></p>

It is not an unfruitful thing to say it, and it is not an easy thing to say it neither. It confers a great deal of benefit, and requires a great deal of grace, which belongs unto it, in the truth and reality of it. The benefit of it, first, is very great; yea, in effect all things else. To say God is ours, is to say the whole world is ours, and a great deal more; it is to give us title to everything which may be requisite or convenient for us. Whatever we can desire or stand in need of, it is all wrapt up in this, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&quot; </span>But then, again, it is a matter of difficulty (as those things which are excellent are). It is a thing which is not so easily said as the world imagines it and thinks it to be. Indeed, it is easy to the mouth, but it is not easy to the heart. It is easy to have a fancy to say it, but it is not to have a faith to say it : this carries some kind of hardship with it, and it is not presently attained unto; but the mind of man withdraws from it. There are two states and conditions in which it is very difficult to say, &quot;O <span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><i>God:&quot; </i>the one is the state of nature and unregeneracy ; and the other is the state of desertion, and the hiding of God&#39;s face from the soul.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Horton </span>(&#8212;1673).</p>

Personal communion with God is the end of our graces; for t reason and the intercourse of it makes men sociable one with another, so the divine nature makes us sociable with God himself: and the life we live by is but an engine, a glass to bring God down to us. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

It is, or should be, the desire of every Christian to see and enjoy more and more of the glory of God. II. That the accomplishment of this design is to be sought by a devout and diligent attendance upon the worship of the sanctuary. How is God&#39;s character in the sanctuary manifested to believers? 1. By the ministry of reconciliation&#8212;by the exhibition of gospel truth. 2. Believers grow in their knowledge of the divine character in the sanctuary, by observing and feeling the application of those great doctrines to the souls of men, by the power and influence of the Holy Spirit. III. The effects that result to the believer in his history and experience, from an increasing knowledge of the power and glory of God. The effects of this knowledge are great and manifold. 1. The believer, by fresh displays of the divine glory, is disenchanted from the fascination of the world. 2. Another effect of an increasing acquaintance with God, and of every view of the divine glory we obtain, is that the mind is disentangled from the embarrassments into which it is sometimes thrown by the aspect of providence. 3. By seeing the divine power and glory in the sanctuary, we shall have our strength renewed to go on our Christian course afresh. 4. A view of the divine glory crucifies our lusts, and puts the corruptions of our heart to death. 5. Fresh views of the divine power and glory nourish our humility. 6. These views of the divine glory in the sanctuary arm us for our conflict with the last enemy. Concluding remarks: 1. That it is characteristic of every good man, that he is devoutly attached to the solemnities of public worship. 2. That his object in going to the sanctuary is definite and distinct.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Angell </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>James. </span></p>

Compare Isaiah Ix. 19, with James iv. 14. Who would not, therefore, hate his own life, which hangs in doubt continually before him, and of which he can have no assurance, when he knows that the living God is his certain portion?

I. I will endeavour, then, in the first place, to show how the Lord sanctifies the souls of men as with marrow and fatness. And, in general, it may be observed, that he imparts such satisfaction by condescending to hold communion with them. This is the feast which our Lord promises to every sinner who opens his heart to receive him: &quot;Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.&quot; Rev. iii. 20. This was also the banquet to which the spouse of Christ was admitted, when she said, &quot;He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.&quot; S. Song ii. 4.
