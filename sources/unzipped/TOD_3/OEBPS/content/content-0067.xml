It is evident that David insists still upon the figure of the whiteness of silver, which he had previously introduced. The country had, as it were, been blackened or sullied by the hostile confusion into which it was thrown, and he says that it had now recovered its fair appearance, and resembled Salmon, which is well known to have been ordinarily covered with snows. Others think that salmon is not the name of a place, but an appellative, meaning <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dark </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shade. </span>I would retain the commonly received reading. At the same time, I think that there may have been an allusion to the etymology. It comes from the word D<sup>1</sup>???, <span style='font-style:italic;'>tselcm, </span>signifying <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shade, </span>and Mount Salmon had been so called on account of its blackness. This makes the comparison more striking; for it intimates that as the snows whitened this black mountain, so the country had resumed its former beauty, and put on an aspect of joy, when God dispelled the darkness which had lain upon it during the oppression of enemies.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

As snow is much less common, and lies a much shorter time in Judoia than in England, no wonder that it is much more admired; accordingly, the son of Sirach speaks of it with a kind of rapture. &quot;The eye will be astonished at the beauty of its whiteness, and the heart transported at the raining of it.&quot; Ecclus. xliii. 18 or 20.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Burder. </span></p>

The &quot;hill of God&quot; is here an emblem of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>world-kingdoms, </span>which (Psalm lxv. 6) are great only by the grace of God. A great hill reminds us of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>creative </span>power of God. Hence, &quot;the hill of Elohim&quot; (the general name of God as <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Creator) </span>stands in contrast to <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hill </span>which (verse 16) &quot;the Lord&quot; (Jehovah) will dwell in for ever. It lay in the north, in the region east of Jordan, or the land of Hermon, the kingdom of 0g, the most formidable enemy whom Israel encountered on their march to Canaan. &quot;The hill of Bashan is the high snow-summit of Anti-Lebanon, or Hermon, the extreme limit of Bashan. There was a peculiar propriety, from its position on the boundary between Judea and the heathen world, in employing it as a symbol of the world&#39;s might (verse 22 ; Psalm xlii. 6; lxxxix. 12)&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>(Hengstenberg). </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span>original name of Hermon was Sion; <span style='font-style:italic;'>i.e., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lofty </span>(Deut. iv. 48); allied in sound to Zion, which suggested the contrast here between <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wrld-hills </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hill.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>A. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>R. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Fausset. </span></p>

To take &quot;captivity captive,&quot; signifies that Christ conquered the allied principalities and powers, the devil, sin, death, and hell; and that he deprived them of the instruments wherewith they enslaved men. He not only silenced the cannon on the spiritual Gibraltar, but he took rock, fortification, and all. He not only silenced the horrible and destructive battlements of the powerful and compactly-united ghostly enemies, but he threw down the towers, razed the castles, and took away the keys of the dungeons. He is the Master henceforth, and for ever. He did, also, at the same time, save his people. Where, O Jesus, is the army of which thou art the Captain ?&quot; Here&#39; s all the names are written in pearls on the breastplate which I wear as a high-priest.&quot; He had no sooner left the grave, than he began to distribute his gifts, and did so all along the road on his way to his Father&#39;s house; and, especially after he entered the heaven of heavens, did he shower down gifts unto men, as a mighty conqueror loaded with treasures with which to enrich and adorn his followers and people. They were gifts of mercy: gifts to the rebellious; to those who threw down their arms at his feet in penitent submission, &quot;that the Lord God may dwell among them.&quot; The apostle shows that a portion of these gifts are gifts of ministry. Accordingly, whenever God condescends to dwell among a people and in a country, he gives that people and country this ministry. He sends them his gospel in the mouths of faithful servants. He establishes there his house; the board and the candlestick ; and then, in his Spirit, he dwells there and blesses his heritage. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Christmas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Evans. </span>1766&#8212;1838.</p>

Rosenmttller expounds Ps. xviii., and never mentions the name of Christ; and the neologists in general see no Messiah in the Old Testament. To these, indeed, Eph. iv. 8, if they had any modesty, would present a formidable obstacle. Paul asserts the Psalm belongs to Christ, and they assert he is mistaken, and that he has perverted (De Wette) and destroyed its meaning. They assert that <span style='font-style:italic;'>Lamarom, </span>&quot;on high,&quot; means the heights of Mount Zion, and Paul says it means heaven. Which is right? (see the scriptural usage of the word, Ps. vii. 7 ; xviii. 16 ; xciii. 4; cii. 19; Jer. xxv. 30; Is. xxxvii. 23).

He gives gifts, or the gift of gifts, the gift of the Holy Ghost. &quot;If thou knewest the gift of God,&quot; said Christ to the Samaritan woman (John iv. 10) : that gift was the water of life, and that water of life was the Spirit, as John, who knew best his mind, gave the interpretation, &quot;This spake he of the Spirit.&quot; John vii. 39. O my soul, consider of this princely gift of Christ! Such a gift was never before, but when God gave his Son. &quot;God so loved the world,&#39;that he gave his Son;&quot; and Christ so loved the world, that he gave his Spirit. But, O my soul, consider especially to whom this Spirit was given; the application of the gift is the very soul of thy meditation: &quot;unto us a Son is given,&quot; said the prophet (Isai. ix. 6) ; and &quot;unto us the Holy Ghost is given,&quot; saith the apostle (Rom. v. 5); and yet above all consider the reasons of this gift in reference to thyself.

And, as God then &quot; led captivity captive&quot; in the destruction of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, who had long held his people in captivity and under cruel bondage; so dealt the Lord Christ now in the destruction and captivity of Satan and all his powers (Col. ii. 15) ; only, whereas it is said in the Psalm that he &quot; received gifts for men,&quot; here (Eph; iv. 8) it is said that &quot;he gave gifts to men,&quot; wherein no small mystery is couched; for, although Christ is God, and is so gloriously represented in the Psalm, yet an intimation is given that he should act what is here mentioned in a condition wherein he was capable to receive from another, as he did in this matter. Acts ii. 33. And so the phrase in the original doth more than insinuate: 0&quot;W3 norm nnp<sup>1</sup>? &quot;Thou hast received gifts in Adam,&quot;&#8212;in the man, or human nature. np7 signifies as well to <span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span>as to <span style='font-style:italic;'>receive, </span>especially when anything is received to be given. Christ received this gift in the human nature to give it unto others. Now, to what end is this glorious theatre, as it were, prepared, and all this preparation made, all men being called to the preparation of it? It was to set out the greatness of the gift he would bestow, and the glory of the work which he would effect; and this was to furnish the church with ministers, and ministers with gifts for the discharge of their office and duty. And it will one day appear that there is more glory, more excellence, in giving one poor minister unto a congregation, by furnishing him with spiritual gifts for the discharge of his duty, than in the pompous instalment of a thousand popes, cardinals, or metropolitans. The worst of men, in the observance of a few outward rites and ceremonies, can do the latter; Christ only can do the former, and that as he is ascended up on high to that purpose.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><i>Owen. </i></p>

It may be laid down as an incontrovertible truth, that David, in reigning over God&#39;s ancient people, shadowed forth the beginning of Christ&#39;s eternal kingdom. This must appear evident to every one who remembers the promise made to him of a never-failing succession, and which received its verification in the person of Christ. As God illustrated his power in David, by exalting him with the view of delivering his people, so has he magnified his name in his only begotten Son. But let us consider more particularly how the parallel holds. Christ, before he was exalted, emptied himself of his glory, having not merely assumed the form of a servant, but humbled himself to the death of the cross. To show how exactly the figure was fulfilled, Paul notices, that what David had foretold was accomplished in the person of Christ, by his being cast down to the lowest parts of the earth in the reproach and ignominy to which he was subjected, before he ascended to the right hand of his Father. Ps. xxii. 7. That in thinking upon the ascension, we might not confine our views to th. body of Christ, our attention is called to the result and fruit of it, in his subjecting heaven and earth to his government. Those who were formerly his inveterate enemies he compelled to submission and made tributary; this being the effect of the word of the Gospel, to lead men to renounce their pride and their obstinacy, to bring down every high thought which exalteth itself, and reduce the senses and the affections of men to obedience unto Christ. As to the devils and reprobate men who are instigated to rebellion and revolt by obstinate malice, he holds them bound by secret control, and prevents them from executing intended destruction. So far the parallel is complete. Nor, when Paul speaks of Christ having <span style='font-style:italic;'>given </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gifts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men, </span>is there any real inconsistency with what is here stated, although he has altered the words, having followed the Greek version in accommodation to the unlearned reader. It was not himself that God enriched with the spoils of the enemy, but his people; and neither did Christ seek, or need to seek, his advancement, but made his enemies tributary, that he might adorn his Church with the spoil. From the close union subsisting between the head and members, to say that God manifest in the flesh received gifts from the captives, is one and the same thing with saying that he distributed them to his Church. What is said in the close of the verse is no less applicable to Christ; that he obtained his victories that as God he might dwell among us. Although he departed, it was not that he might remove to a distance from us, but, as Paul says, &quot;that he might fill all things.&quot; Eph. iv. 10. By his ascension to heaven, the glory of his divinity has been only more illustriously displayed; and, though no longer present with us in the flesh, our souls receive spiritual nourishment from his body and blood, and we find, notwithstanding distance of place, that his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

Prepare, I beseech you, both your ears for David&#39;s song, and your hearts and tongues for your own.

Neither is it for nothing that from this word =p3, <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bless, </span>is derived <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>knee, </span>which is bowed in blessing; and the crier before <span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span>proclaimed <span style='font-style:italic;'>Abrech, </span>calling for the honour of the knee from all beholders. Gen. xli. 43. Every slight, trivial acknowledgment of worth is a praise ; blessing is in a higher strain of gratitude, that carries the whole sway of the heart with it in a kind of divine rapture. Praise is a matter of compliment; blessing of devotion. The apostle&#39;s rule is, <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>less </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>greater, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Abraham </span>of the King of Salem, the prophet&#39;s charge is, that <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>greater </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>should </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>less, </span>yea, the greatest of the least, God of man. This agrees well; blessing is an act that will bear reciprocation; God blesseth man, and man blesseth God. God blesseth mun imperatively; man blesseth God optatively. God blesseth man in the acts of mercy; man blesseth God in the notions, in the expressions of thanks. God blesses man when he makes him good and happy; man blesseth God when he confesseth how good, how gracious, how glorious he is; so as the blessing is wholly taken up in agnition,* in celebration : in the one we acknowledge the bounty of God to us; in the other we magnify him vocally, really, for that bounty. O see, then, what high account God makes of the affections and actions of his poor, silly, earth-creeping creatures; that he gives us in them power to bless himself, and takes it as an honour to be blessed of us. <span style='font-style:italic;'>David </span>wonders that God should so vouchsafe to bless man ; how much more must we needs wonder at the mercy of God, that will vouchsafe to be blessed by man,</p>

And then, lastly, the continuation and knitting of this building, that He that is our God, is the God of all salvation, consists in this, Unto this God the Lord belong the issues of death, that is, that this God the Lord, having united and knit both natures in one, and being God, having also come into this world, in our flesh, he could have no other means to save us, he could have no other issue out of this world, no return to his former glory, but by death. And so in this sense, this <span style='font-style:italic;'>exitus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mortis, </span>the issue of death, is <span style='font-style:italic;'>liberatio </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>per </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mortem, </span>a deliverance by death, by the death of this God our Lord, Christ Jesus; and this, St. Augustine&#39;s acceptation of the words, and those many and great persons that have adhered to him. In all these three lines then, we shall look upon these words, first, as the God of power, the Almighty Father, rescues his servants from the jaws of death ; and then, as the God of mercy, the glorious Son rescued us by taking upon himself the issue of death; and then (between these two), as the God of comfort, the Holy Ghost rescues us from all discomfort, by his blessed impressions before; that what manner of death soever be ordained for us, yet this <span style='font-style:italic;'>exitus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mortis </span>shall be <span style='font-style:italic;'>introitus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vitam, </span>our issue in death shall be an entrance into everlasting life.

Israel had their lesser congregations in ordinary every Sabbath-day, and their national ones three times a year. Their business in all was <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><i>bless </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span>2. This business was to be carried on by <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel, </span>beginning at the fountain head, and proceeding through all its streams. God had blessed Israel; let Israel bless God. 3. All the tribes are supposed to be present; four are mentioned in the name of the whole, as inhabiting the confines of the land. Their union was a source of joy; they had been divided by civil wars, but now they are met together. 4. Those tribes which are named had each something particular attending it. Little Benjamin (see Judges xxi.) had nearly been a tribe lacking in Israel, but now appears with its ruler. Judah had been at war with Benjamin: Saul was a Benjamite; David was of Judah : yet they happily lost their antipathies in the worship of God. Zebulun and Naphtali were distant tribes; yet they were there! dark, too, yet there. 5. The princes and the people were all together. 6. They were supposed to be strong, but were reminded that what they had of strength was of God&#39;s commanding. Their union and success, as well as that degree of righteousness among them which exalted the nation, was of God. They are not so strong, but that they need strengthening, and are directed to pray as well as praise: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Strengthen, </span><i>O </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><i>that </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><i>hast </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>wrought </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span>us.&quot;</p>

Two things are here exemplified, namely&#8212;diligence and brotherly union; and three things recommended, namely&#8212;united praise; united acknowledgment that, for what they are, they are indebted to God; and united prayer for future mercies. Each of these affords a rule for us. 1. Tho worship of God must be attended with <span style='font-style:italic;'>diligence. </span>There are the princes of Zebulun and Naphtali. They had to travel about two hundred miles three times &#39;d year, thither and back again; that is, twelve hundred in a year, twenty-four miles a week. Those who neglect the worship of God for &quot;little difficulties show that their heart is not in it, and when they do attend cannot expect to profit: &quot;they have snuffed at it.&quot; Those whose hearts are in it often reap great advantage. God blessed the Israelites in their journeys, as well as when there (Psalm lxxxiv. 6): &quot;The rain filleth the pools;&quot; and so the Christians. There is a peculiar promise to those that seek him <span style='font-style:italic;'>early. </span>2. The worship of God must be attended to with <span style='font-style:italic;'>brotherly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>love. </span>All the tribes must go up together. It is a kind law that enjoins <span style='font-style:italic;'>social </span>worship; we need each other to stimulate. &quot;O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.&quot; God has made us so that we shall be greatly influenced by each other, both to good and evil. It greatly concerns us to cultivate such a spirit. To this end we must cherish an affectionate behaviour in our common intercourse &#8212;bear, forbear, and forgive; and, whatever differences we may have, not suffer them to hinder our worship. The tribes, as we have seen, had their differences; yet they were there. When all Israel met at Hebron to anoint David king, what should we have said if some had kept away because others went? 3. Our business, when assembled, must be to <i>bless </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>in our congregations; and <span style='font-style:italic;'>% </span><a id='GBS.PA252.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.267.1.0.box.258.263.1271.675.q.60'>
pleasant work this is. Israel had reasons, and great reasons, and Christians more. Thank him for his unspeakable gift; bless him for the means of grace, and the hopes of glory. Bless him; he &quot;healeth all thy diseases,&quot; etc. Psalm ciii. This is an employment that fits for heaven. The tears of a mourner in God&#39;s house were supposed to defile his altar. We may mourn for <i>sin; </i>but a fretful spirit, discontented and unthankful, defiled God&#39;s altar still. 4. Another part of our business is to unite in acknowledging that whatever we are, we owe it to God alone ; &quot;Thy God hath commanded thy strength.&quot; We possess a degree of strength both individually and socially. Art thou strong in faith, in hope, in zeal? It is in him thou art strong. Are we strong as a society? It is God that increaseth us with men like a flock; it is he that keeps us in union, gives us success, etc. 5. Another part of our business must be to unite in prayer for future mercies. We are not so strong, either as individuals or societies, but that there is room for increase; and this is the proper object of prayer. God has wrought a great work for us in regeneration. God has wrought much for us as a church in giving us increase, respect, and room in the earth. Pray that each may be increased ; or, in the words of the text: <i>&quot;Strengthen, O </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><i>hast </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>wrought </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us.&quot; </span>Are there none who are strangers to all this ?&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Andrew </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Fuller. </span></span></p>

The ark of God had during several years been kept in private houses. David had pitched a tent for its reception, and intended providing a better shrine; he would deposit the ark in the temporary sanctuary, and he gathers thirty thousand chosen men of Israel, and with these and with a multitude of the people he proceeds to the house in which the ark had been kept. The people <span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span>render the service of song, so &quot;David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of firwood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals&quot; (2 Sam. vi. 5). The breach of Uzzah delayed the restoration of the ark three months; but David returned to the work, and with gladness, with burnt offerings and peace offerings, with feasting, dancing, and the sound of a trumpet, he brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the tabernacle he had pitched for it. David <span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span>provide mas sacred place for the ark of his God, and his &quot; God has commanded his strength.&quot; Thirty thousand chosen men <span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span>attend on this occasion, and a multitude besides. Then, why should they tarry at home? The occasion is worthy of their presence, and their &quot; God has commanded their strength.&quot; There are sweet singers and skilful players in Israel, and why should they be silent. The occasion calls for praise, and their &quot; God has commanded their strength.&quot; There are cattle upon the thousand hills of Canaan, and shall no sacrifice be brought?

God&#39;s ark <span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span>be brought to this mountain, and if it can be, it ought to be, for Israel God has commanded Israel&#39;s strength.
