Some regard the bands of death as hindrances, as if it were said&#8212; They suddenly die, in a moment, nor are they racked with pains, as in Job xxi. 13. It is considered the highest felicity for the profane, when they have enjoyed the pleasures and the pomp of life, to descend in an instant to the grave. Even Julius Caesar, on the day before he was slain, declared that it seemed to him to be a happy death to die suddenly and unexpectedly. Therefore, according to these interpreters, David complains that the ungodly, without the vexations of disease, pass on to death by a smooth and tranquil course; but there is more truth in the opinion of those who, reading both clauses of the verse together, their strength is firm, and there are no bands to death, think that they are not dragged to death like captives; for since diseases overcome our strength, they are so many messengers of death to admonish us of our frailty. They are not, therefore, in vain compared to chains with which God binds us to his yoke lest vigour and strength should incite us to be froward. <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&quot;</sup>But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>firm.&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Franciscus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Vatablus. </span></p>

time in this world, and to luxuriate in pleasures while in it, but that their condition here is that of pilgrims, whose aspirations, during their earthly pilgrimage, should be towards heaven.

When, therefore, we are here told that men are unfit for contemplating the arrangements of divine providence, until they obtain wisdom elsewhere than from themselves, how can we attain to wisdom but by submissively receiving what God teaches us, both by his word and by his Holy Spirit? David by the word &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>sanctuary&#39;&#39; </span>alludes to the external manner of teaching, which God had appointed among his ancient people ; but along with the word he comprehends the secret illumination of the Holy Spirit.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></span></p>

A certain hermit that was much tempted, and was utterly unsatisfied concerning the providence of God, resolved to journey from place to place till he met with some who could satisfy him. An angel in the shape of a man joined himself with him as he was journeying, telling him that he was sent from God to satisfy him in his doubts of providence. The first night they lodged at the house of a very holy man, and they spent their time in discourses of heaven, and praises of God, and were entertained with a great deal of freedom and joy. In the morning, when they departed, the angel took with him a great cup of gold. The next night they came to the house of another holy man, who made them very welcome, and exceedingly rejoiced in their society and discourse; the angel, notwithstanding, at his departure killed an infant in the cradle, which was his only son, he having been for many years before childless, and, therefore, was a very fond father of this child. The third night they came to another house, where they had like free entertainment as before. The master of the family had a steward&quot; whom he highly prized, and told them how happy he accounted himself in having such a faithful servant. Nest morning he sent this his steward with them part of their way, to direct them therein. As they were going over the bridge the angel flung the steward into the river and drowned him. The last night they came to a very wicked man&#39;s house, where they had very untoward entertainment, yet the angel, next morning, gave him the cup of gold. All this being done, the angel asked the hermit<a id='GBS.PA357.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.372.1.0.box.91.310.1303.880.q.60'>
whether he understood those things? He answered, his doubts of Providence were increased, not resolved, for he could not understand why he should deal so hardly with those holy men, who received them with so much love and joy, and yet give such a gift to that wicked man who used them so unworthily. The angel said, I will now expound these things unto you. The first house where we came the master of it was a holy man ; yet, drinking in that cup every morning, it being too large, it did somewhat unfit him for holy duties, though not so much that others or himself did perceive it; so I took it away, since it is better for him to lose the cup of gold than his temperance. The master of the family where we lay the second night was a man given much to prayer and meditation, and spent much time in holy duties, and was very liberal to the poor all the time he was childless; but as soon as he had a son he grew so fond of it, and spent so much time in playing with it, that he exceedingly neglected his former holy exercise, and gave but little to the poor, thinking he could never lay up enough for his child; therefore I have taken the infant to heaven, and left him to serve God better upon earth. The steward whom I did drown had plotted to kill his master the night following; and as to that wicked man to whom I gave the cup of gold, he was to have nothing in the other world, I therefore gave him something in this, which, notwithstanding, will prove a snare to him, for he will be more intemperate; and &quot; let him that is filthy be filthy still.&quot; The truth of this story I affirm not, but the moral is very good, for it shows that God is an indulgent father to the saints when he most afflicts them; and that when he sets the wicked on high he sets them also in slippery places, and their prosperity is their ruin.

This is not usual in the writings of human authors, who praise themselves to the utmost of what they could, and rather than lose a drop of applause they will lick it up with their own tongues. Tully writes very copiously in setting forth the good service which he did the Roman state, but not a word of his covetousness, of his affecting popular applause, of his pride and vain glory, of his mean extraction and the like. Whereas, clean contrary, Moses sets down the sin and punishment of his own sister, the idolatry and superstition of Aaron his brother, and his own fault in his preposterous striking the rock, for which he was excluded the land of Canaan. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Fuller. </span></p>

What are saints? what are angels, to a soul without God? &quot;Tistrue of things as well as of persons. What have we in heaven but God? What&#39;s joy without God? What&#39;s glory without God <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>What&#39;s all the furniture and riches, all the delicacies, yea, all the diadems of heaven, without the God of heaven? If God should say to the saints.

Heaven is not heaven unless we enjoy God. &#39;Tis the presence of God which makes heaven : glory is but our nearest being unto God. As Mephiboshcth replied, when David told him, &quot;I have said, thou and Ziba divide the land :&quot; &quot; Let him take all, if he will,&quot; saith Mephibosheth, I do not so much regard the land as I regard thy presence; &quot;Let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house,&quot; where I may enjoy him. So if God should say to the saints, Take heaven amongst you, and withdraw himself, they would even say, Nay, let the world take heaven, if they will, if we may not have thee in heaven, heaven will be but an earth, or rather but a hell to us. That which saints rejoice in, is that they may be in the presence of God, that they may sit at his table, and eat bread with him; that is, that they may be near him continually, which was Mephibosheth&#39;s privilege with David. That&#39;s the thing which they &quot;desire and which their souls thirst alter; that&#39;s the wine they would drink. &quot;My soul,&quot; saith David (Psalm xlii. 2), &quot;thirsteth for God, for the living God ; when&quot; (methinks the time is very long, when) &quot;shall I come and appear before God ?&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl. </span></p>

On joining the party, however, he learned that, owing to some unforeseen occurrence, this friend was not to be present, and felt too much chagrined to take any share in the hilarity. The circumstance afterwards led him into the following train of thought : The pious soul, that sincerely loves and fervently longs for the Lord Jesus, experiences what I lately did. She seeks her Beloved in all places, objects, and events. If she find him, who is happier? If she find him not, who more disconsolate? Ah ! Lord Jesus, thou best of friends, thou art the object of my love; my soul seeketh thee, my heart longeth after thee. What care I for the world, with all its pleasures and pomps, its power and glory, unless I find thee in it? What care I for the daintiest food, the sweetest drinks, and the merriest company, unless thou art present, and unless I can dip my morsel in thy wounds, sweeten my draught with thy grace, and hear thy pleasant words. Verily, my Saviour, were I even in heaven, and did not find thee there, it would seem to me no heaven at all. Wherefore, Lord Jesus, when with tears, sighs, yearnings of heart, and patient hope, I seek thee, hide not thyself from me, but suffer me to find thee; for, &quot;Lord! whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.

I. The order inverted. When he mentions his malady he begins with the failing of the flesh, and then of the heart ; but when he reports the relief he begins with that of the heart. From hence observe <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><i>God </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>works </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cure </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lose) </span><i>he </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>begins </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cures </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>first. </span>And there may be these reasons for it. 1. Because the sin of the heart is often the procuring cause of the malady of body and soul. 2. The body ever fares the better for the soul, but not the soul for the body. 3. The cure of the soul is the principal cure. II. The suitableness of the remedy to the malady. Strength of heart for failing of heart, and a blessed portion for the failing of the flesh. Observe, <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>proportionate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>remedy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>relief </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>maladies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>afflictions </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whatsoever, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>both </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>within </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>without. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>If </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>your </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hearts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fail </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>you, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>if </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>your </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flesh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fails </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>you, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>or </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comforts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fail </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>you, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>portion. </span>III. The prophet&#39;s interest; he calls God his portion. Observe, <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>true </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israelites </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>undoubted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>interest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God:</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>theirs. </span>IV. The prophet&#39;s experience in the worst time. He finds this to be true, that when communicated strength fails, there is a never-failing strength in God. Observe, <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christians&#39; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>experiences </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all-sufficiency </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>then </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fullest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><i>highest </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><i>dis </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>comforts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fail </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them. </span>V. There is the prophet&#39;s improvement of his experience for support and comfort against future trials and temptations. Observe, <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saint&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consideration </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>experience </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all-sufficiency </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>times </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exigency, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enough </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vp </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fortify </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>/iis </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>spirit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trials </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tempta</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tions </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>time </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come. </span>Thus you may improve the text by way of observation ; but there are two principal doctrines to be insisted on. First, that God is the rock of a saint&#39;s heart, his strength, and his portion for ever. Secondly, that divine influence and relief passeth from God to his people when they stand in most need thereof. 1st. God is the rock of a saint&#39;s heart, strength, and portion for ever. Here are two members or branches in this doctrine. 1. That God is the rock of a saint&#39;s heart, strength. 2. That God is the portion of a saint. Branch 1. God is the rock of a saint&#39;s heart, strength. He is not only strength, and the strength of their hearts, but the rock of their strength ; so Isaiah xvii. 10. Psalm lxii. 7, <i>nu, </i>the same word that is used in the text, from hence comes our English word &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>sure.&quot; </span>Explication. God is the rock of our strength, both in respect of our naturals and also of our spirituals: he is the strength of nature and of grace (Psalm xxvii. 1) ; the strength of my life<a id='GBS.PA362.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.377.1.0.box.237.284.1284.602.q.50'>
natural and spiritual. God is the strength of thy natural faculties&#8212;of reason and understanding, of wisdom and prudence, of will and affections. He is the strength of all thy graces, faith, patience, meekness, temperance, hope, and charity; both as to their being and exercise. He is the strength of all thy comfort and courage, peace and happiness, salvation and glory. Psalm clx. T. &quot;O God, the rock of my salvation.&quot; In three respects. 1st. He is the author and giver of all strength. Psalm xviii. 32: &quot;It is God that girdeth me with strength.&quot; Psalraxxiv.1l: &quot;He will give strength to his people.&quot; Psalmcxxxviii.3: Psalm lxviii. 35. 2ndly. He is the increaser and perfecterof a saint&#39;s strength; it is God that makes a saint strong and mighty both to do and suffer, to bear and forbear, to believe and to hope to the end ; so Hebrews xi. 34: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;-0ut </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>weakness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>were </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strong;&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>so 1 John ii. 14. And therefore is that prayer of Peter, 1 Peter v. 10. 3rdly. He is the preserver of your strength; your life is laid up in God. Col. iii. 3. Your strength is kept by the strength of God; so Psalm xci. 1. God doth overshadow the strength of saints, that no breach can be made upon it. Psalm lxiii. 7. <i>&quot;In </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shadow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trill </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoice,&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Blackerby. </span>1673.</span></p>

God, &quot;as the hart after the water springs,&quot; Psalm xli. 1. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Fifthly, </span>and especially, <span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>touched </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Spirit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>working </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faith, </span>stirring up dependence, confidence, and trust on God.

Then it is afraid to break with him or to displease him ; but it groweth zealous and resolute, and hot in love, stiff in good cases; resolute against his enemies. And yet this is not all, for God will have also the outward man, so ns the whole man must present itself before God in word, in sacraments; speak of him and to him with reverence, and yet with strength of affection mounting up in prayer, as in a fiery chariot; hear him speak to us; consulting with his oracles; fetching comforts against distresses, directions against maladies. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Sixthly, </span>and especially, we draw near to him <span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>for this is the work of the souls departed, and of the angels in heaven, that are continually near unto him.

A man should make his peace with God, in and through the Mediator Jesus Christ; for, until once that be done, a man must be said to be far from God, and there is a partition-wall standing betwixt God and him.

Be friends with God, and all shall be well with you. II. It is to seek more after communion and fellowship with God, and to pursue after intimacy and familiarity with him; and to have more of his blessed company with us in our ordinary walk and conversation; according to that word, &quot;Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance,&quot; Psalm lxxxix. 15. III. As it stands here in the text, it is the expression of one who hath made up his peace already, and is on good terms with God ; and doth differ a little from what the words absolutely imply; and so we may take it thus, I. It implies the confirming or making sure our interest in God, and so it supposcth the man&#39;s peace to be made with God; for, whoever be the author of this Psalm, it supposeth he has made his peace; and, therefore, in the following words it is subjoined, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;f </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>put </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trust </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord,&quot; </span>etc. ; that is, I have trusted my soul unto God, and made my peace with him through a mediator.

II. It implies to be more conformed unto the image of God, and, therefore, this nearness to him is opposed to that of being far from God. It is good, says he, to draw near to God in our duty; when so many are far from him. III. It implies, to lay by all things in the world, and to seek fellowship and communion with God, and to be more set apart for his blessed company, and to walk with him in a dependence upon him as the great burden-bearer, as he who is to be all in all unto us. In a word, to draw near unto God, is to make our peace with him, and to secure and confirm that peace with him, and to study a conformity unto him, and to be near unto him in our walk and conversation ; in our fellowship, and whole carriage, and deportment, to be always near unto him.-&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Guthrie. </span></p>
