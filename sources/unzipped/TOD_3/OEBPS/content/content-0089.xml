It is a consequence of the respect due to hospitality, which the Arabs hold in such high estimation, and of which they have communicated some shades to the people who dwell among them. They would regard it as a violation of this hospitality not to spare those birds, which come with a perfect confidence to live amongst them, and there to become skilful but useless receptors of love and tenderness.

So Asaph complains. After an acknowledgment that God was the Shepherd of Israel, and so in covenant with his people, and accordingly had wonderfully brought them out of Egypt, and made them flourish marvellously in the land of Canaan, he attributes their misery to God&#39;s neglect. Many reasons may be given of this unkind carriage of God&#39;s people to him. As, first, because their misery blinds them; and blind men when they are smitten suspect every man that comes near them. Secondly, self-love makes us suspect any rather than ourselves, yea, even God himself. The people should have reflected upon themselves that were decent, but in their sorrows they reflect upon God that was innocent. We are all Adam and Eve&#39;s children. When Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, she tacitly lays the fault upon God: &quot;The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.&quot; Gen. iii. 13. Hadst thou not made a subtil serpent I had not broken thy commandment. Adam lays it openly upon God: &quot;The woman whom thou gnvest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&quot; Gen. iii. 12. Hadst thou not given me such a companion to betray me, I had been innocent. So we their posterity, when trouble is upon us, suspect God&#39;s breaking covenant, rather than our own. Thus our nurses<a id='GBS.PA387.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.402.1.0.box.145.288.1301.498.q.60'>
beat the stone when children stumble through their own neglect. Thirdly, in time of need we most commonly suspect such as are best able to help us. The sick man, if he be in danger of death, suspects not his ignorant neighbours, but his skilful physician. He that is oppressed in his estate, when the sentence goes against him, suspects none more than the advocate, or the judge. We know God is best able to help us; our corruption, therefore, makes us to suspect him most, if our troubles continue. Fourthly, we most suspect those who, as we think, have most reason to help us in our miseries, and do it not. If the servant want meal or apparel, he complains not of his fellow servants but of his master, who is tied by covenant to provide for him ; if the child be wronged by the servants, he lays not the fault upon his brethren, but upon his father, who by bands of nature is obliged to take care of him. So we, being in covenant with God, wonder not much if others fail us, but complain heavily if God seems to neglect us.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Francis </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Taylor. </span></span></p>

It is not changed in character since the days when parents made their children to pass through fire to Moloch. At this very day, for instance, infanticide prevails in China ; and the &quot; law,&quot; says a book of authority&#8212;&quot; the law, otherwise so rigorous, does not take the slightest cognisance of that crime, nor ever subjects those guilty of it to punishment. Every morning before it is light, waggons traverse the different quarters of the city of Pekin to receive the dead infants.&quot; Well may they go &quot;before it is light;&quot; &quot; the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.&quot; &quot;The missionaries of that city obtained details, which justify belief that the number of infants (chiefly females) destroyed there is upwards of three thousand annually.&quot; Think of this same proportion, extended throughout that densely-peopled empire. Among the same people, suicide is also of frequent occurrence. What a contrast with the religion which stays the rash hand, and calls out, &quot; Do thyself no harm!&quot;</p>

What painful details were those, which our government brought to light respecting the secret murderers of India! What think you of a vast fraternity of murderers, consisting of many thousands of persons, which has existed from generation to generation, which has been ramified over the whole country from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya mountains, which has flourished alike under Hindoo, Mahometan, and British rulers, and which has every year destroyed multitudes of victims&#8212; and all this under the sanction of religion? The murderous system, they say, has been enjoined them by the goddess Kalee, who is represented as having made a grant of half the human race to her votaries, (to be murdered, that is,) according to certain prescribed forms.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hambleton. </span></p>
