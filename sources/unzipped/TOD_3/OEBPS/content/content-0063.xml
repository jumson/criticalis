The ark would have been a poor leader if the Lord had not been present with the symbol. Before we move, we should always desire to see the Lord lead the way. The words suppose the Lord to have been passive for awhile, suffering his enemies to rage, but restraining his power. Israel beseeches him to &quot;arise,&quot; as elsewhere to &quot;awake,&quot; &quot;gird on his sword,&quot; and other similar expressions. We, also, may thus importunately cry unto the Lord, that he would be pleased to make bare his arm, and plead his own cause. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>scattered.&quot; </span>Our glorious Captain of the vanguard clears the way readily, however many may seek to obstruct it; he has but to arise, and they flee, he has easily over-thrown his foes in days of yore, and will do so all through the ages to come. Sin, death, and hell know the terror of his arm; their ranks are broken t his approach. Our enemies are <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>enemies, and in this is our confidence of victory. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him.&quot; </span>To hate the infinitely good God is infamous, and the worst punishment is not too severe. Hatred of God is impotent. His proudest foes can do him no injury. Alarmed beyond measure, they shall flee before it comes to blows. Long before the army of Israel can come into the fray, the haters of God shall flee before <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Him </span>who is the champion of his chosen. He comes, he sees, he conquers. How fitting a prayer is this for the commencement of a revival! How it suggests the true mode of conducting one :&#8212;the Lord leads the way, his people follow, the enemies flee.</p>

Wicked men are haughty till they come into contact with the Lord, and then they faint for fear; their hearts melt like wax when they feel the power of his anger. Wax, also, burns and passes away; the taper is utterly consumed by the flame: so shall all the boastful power of the opposers of the gospel be as a thing of nought. Rome, like the candles on her altars, shall dissolve, and with equal certainty shall infidelity disappear. Israel saw, in the ark, God on the mercyseat&#8212;power in connection with propitiation&#8212;and they rejoiced in the omnipotence of such a manifestation; this is even more clearly the confidence of the New Testament church, for we see Jesus, the appointed atonement, clothed with glory and majesty, and before his advance all opposition melts like snow in the sun; the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands. When he comes by his Holy Spirit, conquest is the result; but when he arises in person, his foes shall utterly perish.</p>

The marches of God were in the waste howling wilderness. His eternal power and Godhead were there displayed in his feeding, ruling, and protecting the vast hosts which he had brought out of Egypt. The ark brought all this to remembrance, and suggested it as a theme for song. The name Utah is an abbreviation of the name Jehovah; it is not a diminution of that name, but an intensified word, containing in it the essence of the longer, august title.

As the generation which came out of Egypt gradually died away, there were many widows and fatherless ones in the camp, but they suffered no want or wrong, for the righteous laws and the just administrators whom God had appointed, looked well to the interests of the needy. The tabernacle was the Palace of Justice ; the ark was the seat of the great King. This was great cause for joy to Israel, that they were ruled by <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>One </span>who would not suffer the poor and needy to be oppressed. To this day and for ever, God is, and will be, the peculiar guardian of the defenceless. He is the President of Orphanages, the Protector of Widows. He is so glorious that he rides on the heavens, but so compassionate that he rtmembers the poor of the earth. How zealously ought his church to cherish those who are here marked out as Jehovah&#39;s especial charge. Does he not here in effect say, &quot;Feed my lambs&quot; f Blessed duty, it shall be our privilege to make this one of our life&#39;s dearest objects.

Or, would he say that Israel, which had been begrimed in the brick-kilns of Egypt, should come forth lustrous and happy in triumph and liberty? Or, did the song signify that the ark should be brought from its poor abode with Obed-edom into a fairer dwelling-place? It is a hard passage, a nut for the learned to crack. If we knew all that was known when this ancient hymn was composed, the allusion would no doubt strike us as being beautifully appropriate, but as we do not, we will let it rest among the unriddled things. Alexander reads it, &quot;When ye shall lie down between the borders, ye shall be like the wings,&quot; &amp;c, which he considers to mean, &quot;when settled in peace, the land shall enjoy prosperity ;&quot; but this version does not seem to us any more clear than our authorized one. Of making many conjectures there is no end; but the sense seems to be, that from the lowest condition the Lord would lift up his people into joy, liberty, wealth, and beauty. Their enemies may have called them squatters among the pots&#8212;in allusion to their Egyptian slavery; they may have jested at them as scullions of Pharaoh&#39;s kitchen; but the Lord would avenge them and give them beauty for blackness, glory for grime. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dove </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>covered </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>silver, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ana </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>her </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>feathers </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>yellow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gold.&#39;&#39; </span>The dove&#39;s wing flashes light like silver, and anon gleams with the radiance of &quot; the pale, pure gold.&quot; The lovely, changeable colours of the dove might well image the mild, lustrous beauty of the nation, when arrayed in white holiday-attire, bedecked with their gems, jewels, and ornaments of gold. God&#39;s saints have been in worse places than among the pots, but now they soar aloft into the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</p>

The word <span style='font-style:italic;'>white </span>appears to be imported into the text, and by leaving it out the sense is easy. A traveller informed the writer that on a raw and gusty day, he saw the side of what he supposed to be Mount Salmon suddenly swept bare by a gust of wind, so that the snow was driven hither and thither into the air like the down of thistles, or the spray of the sea: thus did the Omnipotent one scatter all the potentates that defied Israel. If our authorized version must stand, the conjectures that the bleached bones of the enemy, or the royal mantles cast away in flight, whitened the battle-field, appear to be rather too far-fetched for sacred poetry. Another opinion is, that Salmon was covered with dark forests, and appeared black, but presented quite another aspect when the snow covered it, and that by this noteworthy change, from sombre shade to gleaming whiteness, the poet sets forth the change from war to peace. Whatever may be the precise meaning, it was intended to pourtray the glory and completeness of the divine triumph over the greatest foes. In this let all believers rejoice.</p>

Zion certainly was not a high hill comparatively; and it is here conceded that Bashan is a greater mount, but not so glorious, for the Lord in choosing Zion had exalted it above the loftier hills. The loftiness of nature is made as nothing before the Lord. He chooses as pleases him, and, according to the counsel of his own will, he selects Zion, and passes by the proud, uplifted peaks of Bashan; thus doth he make the base things of this world, and things that are despised, to become monuments of his grace and sovereignty.</p>

The Lord of Hosts could summon more forces into the field than all the petty lords who boasted in their armies; his horses of fire and chariots of fire would be more than a match for their fiery steeds and flashing cars. The original is grandly expressive: &quot;the war-chariots of Elohim are myriads, a thousand thousands.&quot; The marginal reading of our Bibles, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>many </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thousands,&quot; </span>is far more correct than the rendering, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thousands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>angels.&quot; </span>It is not easy to see where our venerable translators found these &quot;angels,&quot; for they are not in the text; however, as it is a blessing to entertain them unawares, we are glad to meet with them in English, even though the Hebrew knows them not; and the more so because it cannot be doubted that they constitute a right noble squadron of the myriad hosts of God. We read in Deuteronomy xxxiii. 2, of the Lord&#39;s coming &quot;with ten thousands of saints,&quot; or holy ones, and in Heb. xii. 22, we find upon mount Zion &quot;an innumerable company of angels,&quot; so that our worthy translators putting the texts together, inferred the angels, and the clause is so truthfully explanatory, that we have no fault to find with it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>among </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sinai, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>holy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>place,&quot; </span>or, &quot;it is a Sinai in holiness.&quot; God is in Zion as the Commander-in-chief of his countless hosts, and where he is, there is holiness. The throne of grace on Zion is as holy as the throne of justice on Sinai. The displays of his glory may not<a id='GBS.PA221.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.236.1.0.box.78.301.1285.531.q.60'>
be so terrible under the new covenant as under the old ; but they are even more marvellous if seen by the spiritual eye. Sinai has no excellency of glory beyond Zion ; but the rather it pales its light of law before the noontide splendours of Zion&#39;s grace and truth. How joyful was it to a pious Hebrew to know that God was as truly with his people in the tabernacle and temple as amid the terrors of the Mount of Horeb; but it is even more heart-cheering to us to be assured that the Lord abides in his church, and has chosen it to be his rest for ever. May we be zealous for the maintenance of holiness in the spiritual house which God condescends to occupy; let a sense of his presence consume, as with flames of fire, every false way. The presence of God is the strength of the church; all power is ours when God is ours. Twenty thousand chariots shall bear the gospel to the ends of the earth; and myriads of agencies shall work for its success. Providence is on our side, and it &quot;has servants everywhere.&quot; There is no room for a shade of doubt or discouragement, but every reason for exultation and confidence.</span></p>

From the gracious character of his reign it comes to pass that to be led into captivity by him is for our captivity to cease, or to be itself led captive; a glorious result indeed. The Lord Jesus destroys his foes with their own weapons; he puts death to death, entombs the grave, and leads captivity captive. <i>&quot;Thou </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>received </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gifts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men,&quot; </span>or, received gifts among men: they have paid thee tribute, O mighty Conqueror, and shall in every age continue to do so willingly, delighting in thy reign. Paul&#39;s rendering is the gospel one : Jesus has &quot; received gifts for men,&quot; of which he makes plentiful distribution, enriching his church with the priceless fruits of his ascension, such as apostles, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, and all their varied endowments. In him, the man who received gifts for man, we are endowed with priceless treasures, and, moved with gratitude, we return gifts to him, yea, we give him ourselves, our all. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yea, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rebellious </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also:&quot; </span>these gifts the rebels are permitted to share in ; subdued by love, they are indulged with the benefits peculiar to the chosen.

Moreover, the ascension of Jesus is the reason for the descent of the Lord God, the Holy Spirit. Because Jesus dwells with God, God dwells with men. Christ on high is the reason of the Spirit below.

The powers of evil may flee to the utmost ends of the earth, but the Lord will arrest them, and lead them back in chains to adorn his triumph.</p>

Terrible is the God of Israel when he cometh forth as a man of war, and dreadful is even the Christ of God when he bares his arm to smite his enemies. Contemplate Rev. xix. and note the following :&#8212;&quot; And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood;</p>

the Lord had been described; friends and foes had seen his goings forth with the ark and his people.

All nature and providence are, as it were, a procession attending the great Lord, in his visitations of this lower globe. Winter and summer, sun and.moon, storm and calm, and all the varied glories of nature swell the pomp of the King of kings, of whose dominion there is no end.</span></p>
