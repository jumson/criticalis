Jesus calls not the righteous, but sinners to repentance. He does not attempt the superfluous work of aiding proud Pharisees to air their vanity; but he is careful of poor Publicans whose eyes dare not look up to heaven by reason of their sense of sin. We ought to be anxious to be among these needy ones whom the Great King so highly favours.</p>

The fox and the lion are combined against Christ&#39;s lambs, but the Shepherd will defeat them, and rescue the defenceless from their teeth.

Conquerors have reckoned thousands of lives as small items; they have reddened fields with gore, as if blood were water, and flesh but manure for harvests; but Jesus, though he gave his own blood, is very chary of the blood of his servants, and if they must die for him as martyrs, he loves their memory, and counts their lives as his precious things.</p>

As Quesnel well observes, these verses explain themselves. They call rather for profound gratitude, and emotion of heart, than for an exercise of the understanding; they are rather to be used for adoration than for exposition. It is, and ever will be, the acme of our desires, and the climax of our prayers, to behold Jesus exalted King of kings and Lord of lords. He has done great wonders such as none else can match, leaving all others so far behind, that he remains the sole and only wonder-worker; but equal marvels yet remain, for which we look with joyful expectation. He is the Blessed God, and his name shall be blessed; his name is glorious, and that glory shall fill the whole earth.

Before his believing eye the reign of Jesus, like the sun, filled all around with light, and the holy soul of the man after God&#39;s own heart exulted in it, and sung his &quot; Nunc dimittis :&quot; &quot;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!&#39; We, too, will cease from all petitioning if it be granted to us to see the day of the Lord.

One of these is the Hundred and Twenty-seventh, the other is the Seventy-second: and here the traces of his pen are unequivocal. A mistaken interpretation of the note appended to it, &quot;The &#39;prayers of David the Son of Jesse are ended.&quot; led most of the old commentators to attribute the Psnlm to David, and to suppose that it is a prayer offered in his old age &quot; for Solomon,&quot; as the peaceful prince who was to succeed him on the throne. However, it has long been known that the note in question refers to the whole of the preceding portion of the Psalter, much of which was written by Asaph and the sons of Korah; and there can be no doubt that the title can only be translated, &quot;of Solomon.&quot; So clear are the traces of Solomon&#39;s pen that Calvin, whose sagacity in this kind of criticism has never been excelled, although he thought himself obliged, by the note at the end of the Psalm, to attribute the substance of it to David, felt Solomon&#39;s touch so sensibly, that he threw out the conjecture that the prayer was the father&#39;s, but that it was afterwards thrown into the lyrical form by the son. This is not the place for detailed exposition ; I will, therefore, content myself with remarking that, properly speaking, the Psalm is not &quot; for Solomon&quot; at all. If it refers to him and his peaceful reign, it does so only in as far as they were types of the Person and Kingdom of the Prince of Peace. The Psalm, from beginning to end, is not only capable of being applied to Christ, but great part is incapable of being fairly applied to any other.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Binnie. </span></p>

He was &quot;a man of war&quot; (1 Chron. xxviii. 1&#8212;3); the appointed instrument for subjecting the enemies of God&#39;s people Israel, by whom they were put in undisturbed possession of the promised land.

Christless souls are like the dry ground; without the moisture of saving grace their hearts are hard ; neither rods, mercies, nor sermons, make impression upcn them. Why? They are without Christ, the fountain of grace and spiritual influences. Before the fall man&#39;s soul was like a well-watered garden, beautiful, green, and fragrant; but by his apostacy from God, in Adam our first head, the springs of grace and holiness are quite dried up in his soul ; and there is no curing of this drought but by the soul&#39;s union with a new head ; to wit, Christ our second Adam, who has the Spirit given him without measure for the use of all his members. Now, when we are united by faith to Christ, our Head of influences, the dry land is turned into water-springs; Christ &quot;comes down as the rain&quot; by his Spirit of regeneration, and brings the springs of grace into the soul. He is the first and immediate receptacle of the Holy Spirit, and all regenerating and sanctifying influences, and out of his fulness we must by faith receive them. And when at any time the springs of grace are interrupted in the soul by sin or unbelief, so as the ground turns dry, the plants wither, and the things which remain are ready to die, the soul hath need to look up to Jesus Christ to come down with new showers upon the thirsty ground and decayed plants.</span></p>

As the rain is most necessary and suitable to the dry ground, and to the various plants it prqduceth, and also to the different parts of every plant or tree&#8212;such as the root, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit; so Christ is absolutely necessary, and his influence most suitable to all his people&#39;s souls, and to every faculty of them&#8212;the understanding, will, memory, and affections; and to all their different graces, faith, love, repentance, etc. ; to root and establish them, strengthen and confirm them, quicken and increase them, cherish and preserve them. 4. As the rain comes in divers ways and manners to the earth, sometimes with cold winds and tempests, thunders and lightnings, and at other times with calmness and warmth; so Christ comes to sinners, sometimes with sharp convictions and legal terrors, and sometimes with alluring invitations and promises. 5. 0 how pleasant are the effects of rain to languishing plants, to make them green and beautiful, lively and strong, fragrant and beautiful! So the effects of Christ&#39;s influences are most desirable to drooping souls, for enlightening and enlivening them, for confirming and strengthening them, for comforting and enlarging them, for appetizing and satisfying them, transforming and beautifying them. A shower from Christ would soon make the church, though withered, turn green and beautiful, and to send forth a smell as of a field that the Lord hath blessed ; and likewise some drops of this shower, falling down upon the languishing graces of communicants, would soon make them vigorous and lively in showing forth their Saviour&#39;s death at his table.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Jvhn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wilhson. </span></p>

The reader, however, must enlarge his notion beyond that of a mere city, which, how great soever, woud scarcely correspond with the ideas of magnitude, affluence, and power, that the Scriptures suggest.

One of these was descended from Cush, the son of Ham, and the other from Joktan, a descendant of Shem. These two people were often antagonistic in interests, despite the similarity of their names, but their divisions would be healed, and unitedly they would offer tribute to the Great King. It is an Arab proverb, &quot;divided as the Sabaeans,&quot; but Christ makes them one. &quot;&#39; The Greek geographers usually couple Abyssinia with Yemen, in Arabia, and invariably represent the Abyssinian3 as an Arab or Sabsean race. Modern travellers, also, unanimously agree in recognising the Arab type among those Abyssinian populations which do not belong to the African stock.&quot; That the Sabaean nations were wealthy is clear from the Greek historian Agatharchides. &quot;The Sabseans,&quot; says he, &quot;have in their houses an incredible number of vases and utensils of all sorts, of gold and silver, beds and tripods of silver, and all the furniture of astonishing richness. Their buildings have porticoes with columns sheathed with gold, or surmounted by capitals of silver. On the friezes, ornaments, and the framework of the doors, they place plates of gold encrusted with precious stones. They spend immense sums in adorning these edifices, employing gold, silver, ivory, precious stones, and materials of the greatest value.&quot; They appear, also, to have acquired great wealth by trading, both with India and Africa, their peninsula lying between those two regions. Rich would be their gifts if Lenormant and Chevallier&#39;s description of their commerce be correct. &quot;The principal importations from India were gold, tin, precious stones, ivory, sandalwood, spices, pepper, cinnamon, and cotton. Besides these articles, the storehouses of southern Arabia received the products of the opposite coast of Africa, procured by the Sabseans in the active coasting trade they carried on with this not far distant land, where Mosyton (now Ras Abourgabeh) was the<a id='GBS.PA330.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.345.1.0.box.204.292.1301.318.q.60'>

With the addition of the products of the soil of southern Arabia itself, incense,myrrh,laudanum,precious stones, such as onyx and agates, lastly, aloes from the island of Socotra, and pearls from the fisheries in the Gulf of Oimus, we shall have the list of the articles comprised in the trade of this country with Egypt, and with those Asiatic countries bordering on the Mediterranean; and, at the same time, by considering this list, we may form an idea of how great must have been the importance and activity of such a traffic.&quot;</span></p>

Augustine, and his master, Ambrose of Milan, finding it standing in their Psalters, between the seventy-second and seventy-third Psalms, took it for part of the title of the latter, and tortured their ingenuity in divining its import. Calvin saw that the note is retrospective, but, not having observed its position at the end of a book, he thought it pertained exclusively to the Psalm immediately preceding, and took it to mean that that Psalm embalms the last pr avers of the aged king. But he was at a loss to reconcile this with the two obvious fact, that the <span style='font-style:italic;'>title </span>of the Psalm ascribes it to Solomon, and that quite a different Psalm is elsewhere preserved as &quot;the last words of David &quot; (2 Sam. xxiii. 1). And this perplexity of the great Reformer is shared by the older commentators generally. We get rid of it at once, by simply remarking the position of the note in question. It ia set down after a doxology which marks the end of the Second Book. It has no special reference, therefore, to the seventy-second Psalm. It either refers to the Second Book, or, more probably, to both the First and Second. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><i>Binnie. </i></p>

Answer : The end David had in making the Psalms, prayers, and praises, is one thing; but to make a final end of praying is another. Many several opinions have been given to reconcile this. Some that here end the prayers he made for Solomon. Some that here end the prayers he made in the days of his affliction. Some that here end the praises that he made, not the prayers, turning the word <span style='font-style:italic;'>tepillahs </span>into <span style='font-style:italic;'>tehillahs. </span>Some that here end David&#39;s, the rest that follow are Asaph&#39;s.

Some think it is spoken as the phrase is in Job, ch. 31, last verse: &quot;The words of Job are ended;&quot; and yet he had some words after this, but not so many. But the soundest resolution is this :&#8212;Here ends the prayers of David the son of Jesse; that is, here they are perfected. If any ask hereafter what or where lies the end that all these Psalms were made for? tell them here it lies in this Psalm, and, therefore, placed in the midst of all; as the centre in midst of a circle, all the lines meet here, and all the Psalms determine here; for it is only a prophetical treatise of the kingdom of Christ drawn out to the life, and it is dedicated to Solomon, because here is wisdom; other men had other ends, it may be, but the son of Jesse had no other end in the world but to set out Christ&#39;s kingdom in making of his Psulms.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Streat, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dividing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hoof&quot; </span>1654.</p>
