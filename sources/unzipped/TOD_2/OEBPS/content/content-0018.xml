<a id='GBS.PA64.w.1.0.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' id='para.79.1.0.box.269.285.1297.213.q.60'>free grace: not for my own sake, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><i>name&#39;s </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>sake </span>guide me. Our appeal is not to any fancied virtue in our own names, but to the glorious goodness and graciousness which shine resplendent in the character of Israel&#39;s God. It is not possible that the Lord should suffer his own honour to be tarnished, but this would certainly be the case if those who trusted him should perish. This was Moses&#39; plea, &quot; What wilt thou do unto thy great name?&quot;</p>
<a id='GBS.PA64.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.79.1.1.box.268.497.1298.922.q.60'>4. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Pull </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>net </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>laid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>privily </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>The enemies of David were cunning as well as mighty; if they could not conquer him by power, they would capture him by craft. Our own spiritual foes are of the same order&#8212;they are of the serpent&#39;s brood, and seek to ensnare us by their guile. The prayer before us supposes the possibility of the believer being caught like a bird ; and, indeed, we are so foolish that this often happens. So deftly does the fowler do his work that simple ones are soon surrounded by it. The text asks that even out of the meshes of the net the captive one may be delivered: and this is a proper petition, and one which can be granted ; from between the jaws of the lion and out of the belly of hell can eternal love rescue the saint. It may need a sharp <span style='font-style:italic;'>pull </span>to save a soul from the net of temptation, and a mighty pull to extricate a man from the snares of malicious cunning, but the Lord is equal to every emergency, and the most skilfully placed nets of the hunter shall never be able to hold his chosen ones. Woe unto those who are so clever at net laying: they who tempt others shall be destroyed themselves. Villains who lay traps in secret shall be punished in public. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength.&quot;&#39; </span>What an inexpressible sweetness is to be found in these few words <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;. </span>How joyfully may we enter upon labours, and how cheerfully may we endure sufferings when we can lay hold upon celestial power. Divine power will rend asunder all the toils of the foe, confound their politics and frustrate their knavish tricks; he is a happy man who has such matchless might engaged upon his side. Our own strength would be of little service when embarrassed in the nets of base cunning, but the Lord&#39;s strength is ever available; we have but to invoke it, and we shall find it near at hand. If by faith we are depending alone upon the strength of the strong God of Israel, we may use our holy reliance as a plea in supplication.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA64.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.79.1.2.box.267.1418.1298.818.q.60'>5. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>commit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><i>spirit.&quot; </i>These living words of David were our Lord&#39;s dying words, and have been frequently used by holy men in their hour of departure. Be assured that they are good, choice, wise, and solemn words; we may use them now and in the last tremendous hour. Observe, the object of the good man&#39;s solicitude in life and death is not his body or his estate, but his spirit; this is his jewel, his secret treasure; if this be safe, all is well. See what he does with his pearl! He commits it to the hand of his God; it came from him, it is his own, he has aforetime sustained it, he is able to keep it, and it is most fit that he should receive it. All things are safe in Jehovah&#39;s hands: what we entrust to the Lord will be secure, both now and in that day of days towards which we are hastening. Without reservation the good man yields himself to his heavenly Father&#39;s hand; it is enough for him to be there ; it is peaceful living and glorious dying to repose in the care of heaven. At all times we should commit and continue to commit our all to Jesus&#39; sacred care, then, though life may hang on a thread, and adversities may multiply as the sands of the sea, our soul shall dwell at ease, and delight itself in quiet resting places. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><i>redeemed </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>O </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth.&quot; </span>Redemption is a solid basis for confidence. David had not known Calvary as we have done, but temporal redemption cheered him; and shall not eternal redemption yet more sweetly console us? Past deliverances are strong pleas for present assistance. What the Lord has done he will do again, for he changes not. He is a God of veracity, faithful to his promises, and gracious to his saints; he will not turn away from his people.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA64.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.79.1.3.box.268.2233.1292.110.q.60'>6. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hated </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>regard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lying </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vanities.&#39;&#39; </span>Those who will not lean upon the true arm of strength, are sure to make to themselves vain confidences. Man must have a god, and if he will not adore the only living and true God,<a id='GBS.PA65.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.80.1.0.box.152.292.1302.595.q.60'>
he makes a fool of himself, and pays superstitious regard to a lie, and waits with anxious hope upon a base delusion. Those who did this were none of David&#39;s friends; he had a constant dislike to them : the verb includes the present as well as the past tense. He hated them for hating God; he would not endure the presence of idolaters; his heart was set against them for their stupidity and wickedness. He had no patience with their superstitious observances, and calls their idols vanities of emptiness, nothings of nonentity. Small courtesy is more than Romanists and Puseyists deserve for their fooleries. Men who make gods of their riches, their persons, their wits, or anything else, are to be shunned by those whose faith rests upon God in Christ Jesus; and so far from being envied, they are to be pitied as depending upon utter vanities. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trust </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>This might be very unfashionable, but the psalmist dared to be singular. Bad example should not make us less decided for the truth, but the rather in the midst of general defection we should grow the more bold. This adherence to his trust in Jehovah is the great plea employed all along: the troubled one flies into the arms of his God, and ventures everything upon the divine faithfulness.</span></p>

In our most importunate intercessions, we must find breathing time to bless the Lord: praise is never a hindrance to prayer, but rather a lively refreshment therein. It is delightful at intervals to hear the notes of the high-sounding cymbals when the dolorous sackbut rules the hour. Those two words, <span style='font-style:italic;'>glad </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoice, </span>are an instructive reduplication, we need not stint ourselves in our holy triumph; this wine we may drink in bowls without fear of excess. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>con</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tideral </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trouble.&#39;&#39; </span>Thou hast seen it, weighed it, directed it, fixed a bound to it, and in all ways made it a matter of tender consideration.

He thinks not the worse of them for their rags and tatters. He does not misjudge them and cast them off when their faces are lean with sickness, or their hearts heavy with despondency. Moreover, the Lord Jesus knows us in our pangs in a peculiar sense, by having a deep sympathy towards us in them all; when no others can enter into our griefs, from want of understanding them experimentally, Jesus dives into the lowest depths with us, comprehending the direst of our woes, because he has felt the same. Jesus is a physician who knows every case; nothing is new to him. When we are so bewildered as not to know our own state, he knows us altogether. He has known us and will know us : O for grace to know more of him !&quot; Man, know thyself,&quot; is a good philosophic precept, but &quot;Man, thou art known of God,&quot; is a superlative consolation. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Adversities </span>in the plural&#8212;&quot; Many are the afflictions of the righteous.&quot;</p>

He unbosoms his heart, lays bare his wounds, and expresses his inward desolation. This first sentence pithily comprehends all that follows, it is the text for his lamenting discourse. Misery moves mercy&#8212;no more reasoning is needed. &quot;Have mercy&quot; is the prayer; the argument is as prevalent as it is plain and personal, &quot;I am in trouble.&quot; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consumed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><i>grief.&quot; </i>Dim and sunken eyes are plain indicators of failing health. Tears draw their salt from our strength, and floods of them are very apt to consume the source from which they spring. God would have us tell him the symptoms of our disease, not for his information, but to show our sense of need. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Yea, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>belly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>[or </span><i>body].&quot; </i>Soul and body are so intimately united, that one cannot decline without the other .feeling it. We, in these days, are not strangers to the double sinking which David describes; we have been faint with physical suffering, and distracted with mental distress : when two such seas meet, it is well for us that the Pilot at the helm is at home in the midst of the waterfloods, and makes storms to become the triumph of his art.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA66.w.1.7.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.81.1.7.box.283.1607.1304.744.q.60'>10. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>life </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>spent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grief, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>years </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sighing.&#39;&#39; </span>It had become his daily occupation to mourn; he spent all his days in the dungeon of distress. The sap and essence of his existence was being consumed, as a candle is wasted while it burns. His adversities were shortening his days, and digging for him an early grave. Grief is a sad market to spend all our wealth of life in, but a far more profitable trade may be driven there than in Vanity Fair; it is better to go to the house of mourning than the house of feasting. Black is good wear. The salt of. tears is it healthy medicine. Better spend our years in sighing than in-sinning. The two members of the sentence before us convey the same idea; but there are no idle words in Scripture, the reduplication is the fitting expression of fervency and importunity. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faileth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>because </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity.&#39;&#39; </span>David sees to the bottom of his sorrow, and detects sin lurking there. It is profitable trouble which leads us to trouble ourselves about our iniquity. Was this the psalmist&#39;s foulest crime which now gnawed at his heart, and devoured his strength <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>Very probably it was so. Sinful morsels, though sweet in the mouth, turn out <i>to </i>be poison in the bowels: if we wantonly give a portion of our strength to sin, it will by-and-by take the remainder from us. We lose both physical, mental, moral, and spiritual vigour by iniquity. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bones </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consumed.&quot; </span>Weakness penetrated the innermost parts of his system, the firmest parts of his frame felt the general decrepitude. <span style='font-style:italic;'>A </span>man is in a piteous plight when he comes to, this</p>

We feel most the slights of those who should have shown us sympathy. Perhaps David&#39;s friends feared to be identified with his declining fortunes, and therefore turned against him in order to win the mercy if not the favour of his opponents. Self interest rules the most of men : ties the most sacred are soon snapped by its influence, and actions of the utmost meanness are perpetrated without scruple. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>acquaintance.&#39;&#39;&#39; </span>The more intimate before, the more distant did they become.

The milk of human kindness curdles when a despised believer is the victim of slanderous accusations. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>did </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>see </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wit/iout </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fled </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>Afraid to be seen in the company of a man so thoroughly despised, those who once courted his society hastened from him as though he had been infected with the plague. How villainous a thing is slander which can thus make an eminent saint, once the admiration of his people, to become the general butt, the universal aversion of mankind! To what extremities of dishonour may innocence be reduced!</p>

Men soon forget the deepest obligations; popularity is evanescent to the last degree: he who is in every one&#39;s mouth to-day may be forgotten by all to-morrow. A man had better be dead than be smothered in slander. Of the dead we say nothing but good, but in the psalmist&#39;s case they said nothing but evil. We must not look for the reward of philanthropy this side of heaven, for men pay their best servants but sorry wages, and turn them out of doors when no more is to be got out of them. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>like </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>broken </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vessel,&quot; </span>a thing useless, done for, worthless, cast aside, forgotten.

What the ear does not hear the heart does not rue; but in David&#39;s case the accusing voices were loud enough to break in upon his quiet&#8212;foul mouths had grown so bold, that they poured forth their falsehoods in the presence of their victim. Shimei was but one of a class, and his cry of &quot; Go up, thou bloody man,&quot; was but the common speech of thousands of the son of Belial. All Beelzebub&#39;s pack of hounds may be in full cry against a man, and yet he may be the Lord&#39;s anointed. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Fear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>every </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>side.</span>&quot; He was encircled with fearful suggestions, threatenings, remembrances, and forebodings; no quarter was clear from incessant attack. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Wli&#39;de </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>took </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>counsel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>together </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>devised </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>take </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>away </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>life.&quot; </span>The ungodly act in concert in their onslaughts upon the excellent of the earth: it is to be wondered at that sinners should often be better agreed than saints, and generally set about their wicked work with much more care and foresight than the righteous exhibit in holy enterprises. Observe the cruelty of a good man&#39;s foes! they will be content with nothing less than his blood&#8212;for this they plot and scheme. Better fall into the power of a lion than under the will of malicious persecutors, for the beast may spare its prey if it be fed to the full, but malice is unrelenting and cruel as a wolf. Of all fiends the most cruel is envy. How sorely was the psalmist bestead when the poisoned arrows of a thousand bows were all aimed at his life! Yet in all this his faith did not fail him, nor did his God forsake him. Here is encouragement for us.</p>

The sin is further enhanced by the manner of their speech; they speak proudly and contemptuously; they talk as if they themselves were the cream of society, and the righteous the mere scum of vulgarity. Proud thoughts of self are generally attended by debasing estimates of others. The more room we take up ourselves, the less we can afford our neighbours. What wickedness it is that unworthy characters should always be the loudest in railing at good men! They have no power to appreciate moral worth of which they are utterly destitute, and yet they have the effrontery to mount the judgment seat, and judge the men compared with whom they are as so much drag. Holy indignation may well prompt us to desire anything which may rid the world of such unbearable impertinence and detestable arrogance.</p>

Holy amazement uses interjections where adjectives utterly fail. Notes of exclamation suit us when words of explanation are of no avail.

Dwellers at the foot of the cross of Christ grow callous to the sneers of the haughty.

All the saints are benefited by the sanctified miseries of one, if they are led by earnest exhortations to love their Lord the better. If saints do not love the Lord, who will? Love is the universal debt of all the saved family: who would wish to be exonerated from its payment?

That they may be safe; <span style='font-style:italic;'>i.e., </span>preserved in their passage to heaven, from all the enemies and dangers that may stand in the way. When saints die, the powers of darkness would, doubtless, if possible, hinder the ascending of their souls to God. As they are cast out of heaven, they are filled with rage to see any out of our world going thither. One thing, therefore, which the saint means in committing his spirit into the hands of God, is, that the precious <i>deposit </i>may be kept from all that wish or would attempt its ruin. And they are sure that almighty power belongs to God: and if this is engaged for their preservation, none can pluck them out of his hand. The Redeemer hath spoiled principalities and powers, and proved it by his triumphant ascension to glory; and hath all his and the believer&#39;s enemies in a chain, so that they shall be more than conquerors in and through him. Angels, for order&#39;s sake, are sent forth to minister to them and be their guard, who will faithfully attend them their charge, till they are brought to the presence of the common Lord of both. &quot;I know,&quot; saith the apostle, &quot;whom I have believed ; and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.&quot;</p>

He does not behold his life melting away into the gloomy floods of mortality. He commends it into the hands of his Father. It is not alone in the general spirit of humanity, that he will continue to live. He will live on in the definite personality of his own spirit, embraced by the special protection and faithfulness of his Father. Thus he does not surrender his life despondingly to death for destruction, but with triumphant consciousness to the Father for resurrection. It was the very centre of his testament: assurance of life; surrender of his life into the hand of a living Father. With loud voice he exclaimed it to the world, which will for ever and ever sink into the heathenish consciousness of death, of the fear of death, of despair of immortality and resurrection, because it for ever and ever allows the consciousness of the personality of God, and of personal union with him, to be obscured and shaken. With the heart of a lion, the&#39; dying Christ once more testified of life with an expression which was connected with the word of the Old Testament Psalm, and testified that the Spirit of eternal life was already operative, in prophetic anticipation, in the old covenant. Thus living as ever, he surrendered his life, through death, to the eternally living One. His death was the last and highest fact, the crown of his holy life.- &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>P. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lange, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D.D., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Life </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jesus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christ,&quot; </span>1864.</p>

From the twenty-second he derived those bitter words of anguish, &#39;-&#39; Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&quot; From the present Psalm he derived those last words of love and trust which he uttered just before his death.

There was an old idea, which still prevails amongst the uninstructed, that the eye, under extreme grief, and with a constant profuse flow of tears, might sink away and perish under the ordeal. There is no solid foundation for this idea, but there is a very serious form of disease of the eyes, well known to oculists by the title of Glaucoma, which seems to be very much influenced by mental emotions of a depressing nature. I have known many striking instances of cases in which there has been a constitutional proneness to Glaucoma, and in which some sudden grief has brought on a violent access of the disease and induced blindness of an incurable nature. In such instances the explanation seems to be somewhat as follows. It is essential to the healthy performance of the functions of the eye, that it should possess a given amount of elasticity, which again results from an exact balance between the amount of fluid within the eye, and the external fibrous case or bag that contains or encloses it. If this is disturbed, if the fluid increases unduly in quantity, and the eye becomes too hard, pain and inflammation may be suddenly induced in the interior of the eye, and sight may become rapidly extinguished. There are a special set of nerves that preside over this peculiar physical condition, and keep the eye in a proper state of elasticity ; and it is a remarkable fact, that through a long life, as a rule, we find that the eye preserves this elastic state. If, however, the function of these nerves is impaired, as it may readily be under the influence of extreme grief, or any depressing agent, the eye may become suddenly hard. Until a comparatively recent date, acute Glaucoma, or sudden hardening of the eye, attended with intense pain and inflammation, caused complete and hopeless blindness; but in the present day it is capable of relief by means of an operation. The effect of grief in causing this form of blindness seems to be an explanation of the text, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consumed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><i>grief.&quot; </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>* </span></p>

Nor does this imply that he boasted of being so magnanimous and courageous that he could not be overthrown through the infirmity of the flesh. However contrary to one another they appear, yet these things are often joined together, as they ought to be, in the same person, namely, that while he pines away with grief, and is deprived of all strength, he is nevertheless supported by so strong a hope that he ceases not to call upon God. David, therefore, was not so overwhelmed in deep sorrow, and other direful sufferings, as that the hidden light of faith could not shine inwardly in his heart; nor did he groan so much under the weighty load of his temptations, as to be prevented from arousing himself to call upon God. He struggled through many obstacles to be able to make the confession which he here makes. He next defines the manner of his faith, namely, that he reflected with himself thus, &#8212;that God would never fail him nor forsake him. Let us mark his manner of speech: / <span style='font-style:italic;'>hare </span><i>said, </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span>In these words he intimates that he was so entirely persuaded of this truth, that God was his God, that he would not admit even a suggestion to the contrary. And until this persuasion prevails so as to take possession of our minds, we shall always waver in uncertainty. It is, however, to be observed, that this declaration is not only inward and secret&#8212;made rather in the heart<a id='GBS.PA79.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.94.1.0.box.131.298.1310.285.q.60'>
than with the tongue&#8212;but that it is directed to God himself, as to him who is the alone witness of it. Nothing is more difficult, when we see our faith derided by the whole world, than to direct our speech to God only, and to rest satisfied with this testimony which our conscience gives us, <span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span>And certainly it is an undoubted proof of genuine faith, when, however fierce the waves are which beat against us, and however sore the assaults by which we are shaken, we hold fast this as a fixed principle, that we are constantly under the protection of God, and can say to him freely, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></span></p>

Thus it is that we must not use any compendious way; we may not neglect our body, nor shipwreck our health, nor anything to hasten death, because we shall gain by it. He that maketh haste (even this way) to be rich shall not be innocent; for our times are in God&#39;s hands, and therefore to his holy providence we must leave them. We have a great deal of work to do, and must not, therefore, be so greedy of our Sabbath-day, our rest, as not to be contented with our working-day, our labour. Hence it is that a composed frame of mind, like that of the apostle&#39;s (Phil. i. 21), wherein either to stay and work, or to go and rest, is the best temper of all. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Edward </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Reynolds, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Spencer&#39;s </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>New </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Old.&quot; </span></p>

Poor watch! I called once to see a friend, the physician and the secretary of one of the most noble and admirable of the asylums for the insane in this country. A poor creature, with a clear, bright intelligence, only that some of its chords had become unstrung, who had usually occupied itself innocently by making or unmaking watches, had just before I called, exhibited some new, alarming symptoms, dashing one and then another upon the stone floor, and shivering them. Removed into a more safe room, I visited him with the secretary. &quot;How came you to destroy your favourite watches, so much as you loved them, and so quiet as you are ?&quot; said my friend ; and the poor patient replied, in a tone of piercing agony, &quot;I could not bear the tick.tick, ticking, and so I dashed it on the pavement.&quot; But when the watch is able to surrender itself to the maker, to the hand holding the watch, and measuring out the moments, it becomes a sight affecting indeed, but very beautiful, very sublime.

This we know; but see, some lives fulfil life&#39;s course, gain life&#39;s crown&#8212; life in their degree. This, on the contrary, others quite miss. Yet, for even human strength there must be a love meted out to rule it. It is said, there is a moon to control the tides of every sea; is there not a master power for souls? It may not always be so, apparently, in the more earthly lives, but it is so in the heavenly; not more surely does the moon sway tides than God sways souls. It does seem sometimes as if man found no adequate external power, and stands forth ordained to be a law to his own sphere; but even then his times are in the hands of God, as the pathway of a star is in the limitations of its system&#8212;as the movements of a satellite are in the forces of its planet.

Oh ! what love is due from us to Christ, that has pleaded for us when we ourselves had nothing to say! That has brought us out of a den of lions, and from the jaws of the roaring lion! To say, as Mrs. Sarah Wright did, &quot;I have obtained mercy, that thought my time of mercy past for ever; I have hope of heaven, that thought I was already damned by unbelief; I said many a time, there is no hope in mine end, and I thought I saw it; I was so desperate, I cared not what became of me. Oft was I at the very brink of death and hell, even at the very gates of both, and then Christ shut them. I was as Daniel in the lion&#39;s den, and he stops the mouth of those lions, and delivered me. The goodness of God is unsearchable; how great is the excellency of his majesty, that yet he would look upon such a one as I; that he has given me peace that was full of terror, and walked continually as amidst fire and brimstone.&quot; &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Timothy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Rogers. </span></span></p>

It is the undaunted audacity of a sanctified heart in adventuring upon difficulties and undergoing hardships for a good cause upon the call of God. The <span style='font-style:italic;'>genus, </span>the common nature of it is an undaunted audacity. This animosity, as some phrase it, is common both unto men and to some brutes. The lion is said to be the strongest among beasts, that turneth not away from any. Prov. xxx. 30. And there is an elegant description of the war horse in regard of boldness. Job xxxix. 19, etc. And this boldness that is in brutes is spoken of as a piece of this same <span style='font-style:italic;'>courage </span>that God is pleased to give to men. Ezek. iii. 9. This is the Lord&#39;s promise&#8212;&quot; As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead.&quot; The word &quot;harder &quot;is the same in the Hebrew that is here in my text&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>fort</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iorem </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>petra</span>&#8212;the rock that is not afraid of any weather, summer or winter, sun and showers, heat and cold, frost and snow; it blusheth not, shrinketh not, it changeth not its complexion, it is still the same. Such a like thing is <span style='font-style:italic;'>courage, </span>in the common nature of it. Secondly, consider the subject, it is <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart, </span>the castle where courage commands and exerciseth military discipline; (shall I so say) it&#39;s within the bosom, it is the soul of a valiant soldier. Some conceive our English word <span style='font-style:italic;'>courage </span>to be derived from <span style='font-style:italic;'>cordis </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>actio, </span>the very acting of the heart. A valiant man is described (2 Sam. xvii. 10) for to be a man whose heart is as the heart of a lion. And sometimes the original translated <span style='font-style:italic;'>courageous, </span>as Amos ii. 16, may most properly be rendered <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart. </span>Beloved, valour doth not consist in a piercing eye, in a terrible look, in big words; but it consists in the mettle, the vigour that is within the bosom. Sometimes a coward may dwell at the sign of a roaring voice and of a stern countenance ; whereas true fortitude may be found within his breast whose outward deportment promises little or nothing in that kind. Thirdly, note the qualification of this same subject; I said a sanctified heart; for I am not now speaking of fortitude as a moral virtue, whereof heathens that have not God are capable, and for which many among them that are not Christians, have been worthily commended. But I am now discoursing of courage as a virtue theological, as a gracious qualification, put upon the people of God by special covenant. And there are three things that do characterize it, and which do distinguish it from the moral virtue of fortitude. (1) The <span style='font-style:italic;'>root, </span>whence it ariseth; (2) the <span style='font-style:italic;'>rule, </span>whereby it is directed; (3) the <span style='font-style:italic;'>end, </span>to which it is referred. The <span style='font-style:italic;'>root, </span>whence it ariseth, is <span style='font-style:italic;'>love </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>all the saints of God that love the Lord be of good courage. The love of Christ constraineth me to make these bold and brave adventures, saith the apostle. 2 Cor. v. 14. The <span style='font-style:italic;'>rule, </span>whereby it is directed, is the <span style='font-style:italic;'>word </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God</span>&#8212; what the Lord hath pleased to leave on record for a Christian&#39;s guidance in holy pages. 1 Chron. xxii. 12, 13. &quot;Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God. Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.&quot; Be a man of mettle, but let thy mettle be according to my mind, according to this rule. And the <span style='font-style:italic;'>end, </span>to which it refers, is <span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span>For every sanctified man being a self-denying and a God-advancing man, his God is his centre, wherein his actings, his undertakings rest; and his soul is not, yea, it cannot be satisfied but in God.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Simeon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ash&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Commanders </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Military </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Forces </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>renowned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Citie </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>London, </span>1642.&quot;</p>

that are charged upon all our consciences? The work of mortification, to pick out our eyes, to chop off our bands, to cut off our feet; do you think that a milksop, a man that is not a man of a stout spirit, will do this? Now to massacre fleshly lusts, is (as it were) for a man to mangle and dismember his own body ; it is a work painful and grievous, as for a man to cut off his own feet, to chop off his own hands, and to pick out his own eyes, as Christ and the apostle Paul do express it. Besides this, there are in Christians&#39; bosoms strongholds to be battered, fortifications to be demolished ; there are high hills and mountains that must be levelled with the ground; there are trenches to be made, valleys to be filled. O beloved, I may not mention the hills that lie before us in heaven way, which we must climb up, and craggy rocks that we must get over; and without courage certainly the work put upon our hands will not be discharged. There are also the walls of Jerusalem to be repaired, and the temple to be re-edified. If Nehemiah had not been a man of a brave spirit he would never have gone through stitch with that church work, those weighty services which he did undertake. How this is applicable to us for the present time, the time of our begun reformation, I speak not, but rather do refer it to your considerations. I beseech you to read Neh. iv. 17, 18, &quot;They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded, and he that sounded the trumpet was by me.&quot; While they were at work, they were all ready for war.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Simeon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ash. </span></span></p>

This is the second Psalm of benediction. The first Psalm describes the result of holy blessedness, the thirty-second details the cause of it. The first pictures the tree in full growth, this depicts it in its first planting and watering. He who in the first Psalm is a reader of God&#39;s book, is here a suppliant at God&#39;s throne accepted and heard. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trangression </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>given.&quot; </span>He is now blessed and ever shall be. Be he ever so poor, or sick, or sorrowful, he is blessed in very deed. Pardoning mercy is of all things in the world most to be prized, for it is the only and sure way to happiness. To hear from God&#39;s own Spirit the words, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;absoho </span>&lt;e&quot; is joy unspeakable. Blessedness is not in this case ascribed to the man who has been a diligent lawkeeper, for then it would never come to us, but rather to a lawbreaker, who by grace most rich and free has been forgiven. Self-righteous Pharisees have no portion in this blessedness. Over the returning prodigal, the word of welcome is here pronounced, and the music and dancing begin. A full, instantaneous, irreversible pardon of transgression turns the poor sinner&#39;s hell into heaven, and makes the heir of wrath a partaker in blessing. The word rendered forgiven is in the original <span style='font-style:italic;'>taken </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>off </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>taken </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>away, </span>as a burden is lifted or a barrier removed. What a lift is here! It cost our Saviour a sweat of blood to bear our load, yea, it cost him his life to bear it quite away. Samson carried the gates of Gaza, but what was that to the weight which Jesus bore on our behalf? &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>covered.&#39;&#39; </span>Covered by God, as the ark was covered by the mercyseat, as Noah was covered from the flood, as the Egyptians were covered by<a id='GBS.PA90.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.105.1.0.box.299.294.1293.354.q.60'>
the depths of the sea. What a cover must that be which hides away for ever from the sight of the all-seeing God all the filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit! He who has once seen sin in its horrible deformity, will appreciate the happiness of seeing it no more for ever. Christ&#39;s atonement is the propitiation, the covering, the making an end of sin; where this is seen and trusted in, the soul knows itself to be now accepted in the Beloved, and therefore enjoys a conscious blessedness which is the antepast of heaven. It is clear from the text that a man may <span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span>that he his pardoned : where would be the blessedness of an unknown forgiveness? Clearly it is a matter of knowledge, for it is the ground of comfort.</span></p>

Note the three words so often used to denote our disobedience: trangression, sin, and iniquity, are the three-headed dog at the gates of hell, but our glorious Lord has silenced his barkings for ever against his own believing ones. The trinity of sin is overcome by the Trinity of heaven. Non-imputation is of the very essence of pardon: the believer sins, but his sin is not reckoned, not accounted to him. Certain divines froth at the mouth with rage against imputed righteousness, be it ours to See our sin not imputed, and to us, may there be as Paul words it, &quot;Righteousness imputed without works.&quot; He is blessed indeed who has a substitute to stand for him to whose account all his debts may be set down. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>spirit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><i>guile.&quot; </i>He who is pardoned, has in every case been taught to deal honestly with himself, his sin, and his God. Forgiveness is no sham, and the peace which it brings is not caused by playing tricks with conscience. Selfdeception and hypocrisy bring no blessedness, they may drug the soul into hell with pleasant dreams, but into the heaven of true peace they cannot conduct their victim. Free from guilt, free from guile. Those who are justified from fault are sanctified from falsehood. A liar is not a forgiven soul. Treachery, double-dealing, chicanery, dissimulation, are lineaments of the devil&#39;s children, but he who is washed from sin is truthful, honest, simple, and childlike. There can be no blessedness to tricksters with their plans, and tricks, and shuffling, and pretending: they are too much afraid of discovery to be at ease; their house is built on the volcano&#39;s brink, and eternal destruction must be their portion. Observe the three words to describe sin, and the three words to represent pardon, weigh them well, and note their meanings. (See note at the end.)</p>
