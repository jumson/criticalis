Our prophet solves the important question by one single principle; and, what is more remarkable, this principle, which is nobly expressed, carries the clearest evidence with it. The principle is this: &quot;By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth,&quot; verse 0. This is the most rational account that was ever given of the creation of the world. The world is the work of a self-efficient will, and it is this principle alone that can account for its creation. The most simple appearances in nature are sufficient to lead us to this principle. Either my will is self-efficient, or there is some other being whose will is self efficient. What I say of myself, I say of my parents; and what I affirm of my parents, I affirm of my more remote ancestors, and of all the finite creatures from whom they derived their existence. Most certainly either finite beings have a self-efficient will, which it is impossible to suppose, for a finite creature with a self-efficient will is a contradiction: either, I say, a finite creature has a self-efficient will, or there is a First Cause who has a self-efficient will ; and that there is such a Being is the principle of the psalmist; &quot;By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.&quot;</p>

This is the doctrine of providence. And on what is the doctrine of providence founded? On this principle: God &quot; fashiontth their hearts alike,&quot; verse 15. Attend a moment to the evidence of this reasoning, my brethren. The doctrine of providence expressed in these words, &quot; God considereth the works of the inhabitants of the earth,&quot; is a necessary consequence of his principle, &quot; God fashioneth their hearts alike;&quot; and this principle is a necessary consequence of that which the psalmist had before laid down to account for the origin of the world. Yes, from the doctrine of God<a id='GBS.PA122.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.137.1.0.box.233.311.1296.779.q.60'>
the Creator of men, follows that of God the inspector, the director, rcwarder, and the punisher of their actions. One of the most specious objections that has ever been opposed to the doctrine of providence, is a contrast between the grandeur of God and the meanness of men. How can such an insignificant creature as man be the object of the care and attention of such a magnificent being as God? No objection can be more specious, or, in appearance, more invincible. The distance between the meanest insect and the mightiest monarch, who treads and crushes reptiles to death without tho least regard to them, is the very imperfect image of the distance between God and mini. That which proves that it would be beneath the dignity of a monarch to observe the motions of ants, or worms, to interest himself in their actions, to punish, or to reward them, seems to demonstrate, that God would degrade himself were he to observe, to direct, to punish, to reward mankind, who are infinitely inferior to him. But one fact is sufficient to answer this specious objection: that is, that God has created mankind. Does God degrade himself more by governing than by creating mankind? Who can persuade himself that a wise Being has given to intelligent creatures faculties capable of obtaining knowledge and virtue, without willing that they should endeavour to acquire knowledge and virtue? Or who can imagine, that a wise Being, who wills that his intelligent creatures should acquire knowledge and virtue, will not punish them if they neglect those acquisitions; and will not show by the distribution of his benefits that he approves their endeavours to obtain them?</span></p>

The moral attributes of God, as they are called in the schools, were mysteries which they could not unfold. These may be reduced to two classes; attributes of <span style='font-style:italic;'>goodness, </span>and attributes of <span style='font-style:italic;'>justice. </span>Philosophers, who had admitted these, have usually taken that for granted which they ought to have proved. They collected together in their minds all perfections; they reduced them all to one object which they denominated <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perfect </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>being: </span>and supposing, without proving, that B perfect being existed, they attributed to him, without proof, everything that they considered as a perfection. The psalmist shows by a surer way that there is a God supremely just and supremely good. It is necessary, in order to convince a rational being of the justice and goodness of God, to follow such a method as that which we follow to prove his existence. When we would prove the existence of God, we say, there are creatures, therefore there is a Creator. In like manner, when we would prove that B creature is a just and a good being, we say, there are qualities of goodness and justice in creatures, therefore he, from whom these creatures derive their existence, is a being just and good. Now, this is the reasoning of the psalmist in this Psalm: &quot;The Lord loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord&quot; (verse 5) ; that is to say, it is impossible to consider the woik of the Creator, without receiving evidence of his goodness. And the works of nature which demonstrate the goodness of God, prove his justice also; for God has created us with such dispositions, that we cannot enjoy the gifts of his goodness without obeying the laws of his righteousness. The happiness of an individual who procures a pleasure by disobeying the laws of equity, is a violent happiness, which cannot be of long duration ; and the prosperity of public bodies, when it is founded in iniquity, is an edifice which, with its basis, will be presently sunk and gone.</p>

Singing is the music of <span style='font-style:italic;'>vntvre. </span>The Scripture* tell us the mountains sing (Isa. lv. 12) ; the valleys sing (Ps. xv. 18); the trees of the wood sing (1 Chron. xvi. 33) ; nay, the air is the birds&#39; music room, they chant their musical notes. II. Singing is the music of <span style='font-style:italic;'>ordinances. </span>Augustine reports of himself, that when he came to Milan and heard the people sing, he wept for joy in the church to hear that pleasing melody. And Btza confesses that at his first entrance into the congregation, and hearing them sing the ninetyfirst Psalm, he felt himself exceedingly comforted, and did retain the sound of it afterwards upon his heart. The Rabbins tell us that the Jews, after the feast of the Passover was celebrated, sang the hundred-and-eleventh and five following Psalms; and our Saviour and his apostles sang a hymn immediately after the blessed Supper. Matt. xxvi. 30. III. Singing is the music of <span style='font-style:italic;'>faints. </span>(1.) They have performed this duty in their greatest <i>numbers. </i>Ps. cxlix. 1, 2. (2.) In their greatest <i>straits. </i>Isa. xxvi. 19. (3.) In their greatest <span style='font-style:italic;'>flight. </span>Isa. xlii. 10, 11. (4.) In their greatest <span style='font-style:italic;'>deliverances. </span>(5.) In their greatest <span style='font-style:italic;'>plenties. </span>Isa. lxv. 14. In all these changes singing hath been their stated duty and delight. And indeed it is meet that the saints and servants of God should sing forth their joys and praises to the Lord Almighty : every attribute of him can set both their song and their tunc. IV. Singing is the music of <span style='font-style:italic;'>angels. </span>Job tells us, &quot;the morning stars sang together,&quot; chap. xxxviii. 7. Now these &quot;morning stars,&quot; as Pineda tells us, are the angels; to which the Chaldee paraphrase accords, naming these morning stars, <span style='font-style:italic;'>aciem </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>angelorum, </span>an host of angels. Nay, when this heavenly host was sent to proclaim the birth of our dearest Jesus, they deliver their message in this raised way of duty. Luke ii. 13. They were aivovvre?, delivering their messages in a laudatory singing, the whole company of angels making a musical quire. Nay, in heaven there is the angels&#39; joyous music ; they there sing hallelujahs to the Most High, and to the Lamb who sits upon the throne. Rev. v. 11. V. Singing is the music of <span style='font-style:italic;'>heaven; </span>the glorious saints and angels accent their praises this way, and make one harmony in their state of blessedness; and this is the music of the !ride-chamber. The saints who were tuning here their Psalms, are now singing their hallelujahs in a louder strain, and articulating their joys, which here they could not express to their perfect satisfaction; here they laboured with drowsy hearts, and faltering tongues; but in glory these impediments are removed, and nothing is left to jar their joyous celebration.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><i>Wells, </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Morning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Exercises.&#39;&#39; </span></p>

Those animals which are under our care are still indebted to the earth for their subsistence; for the grass, which nature spontaneously produces, is their chief food. The whole race of fishes, except those which men feed for their amusement, subsist without any of their aid. The species of birds which is perhaps the most despised and most numerous, is the sparrow. What they require for their support is incredible, but nature takes care to feed them; they are however but the smallest part of her children. So great is the quantity of insects, that ages may pass before even their species and classes can be known. How many and how diversified the sorts of flies that play in the air! The blood taken from us, by the gnat is very accidental food for them; and we may suppose that where there is one gnat that lives upon it, there are millions that have never tasted human blood, or that of any other animal. On what can all these creatures subsist? Perhaps every handful of earth contains living insects; they are discovered in every drop of water; their multiplying and means of support are incomprehensible. While nature is thus prolific in children, she is also fruitful in means for their subsistence; or, rather, it is the God of nature who has poured into her bosom this inexhaustible store of riches.

But these are even mutually helpful ; and they are, not only never so beautiful, but never so influential as when they are blended. The fear promotes hope by the evidence it affords; and by keeping us from loose and careless walking, which must always affect our peace and pleasure. And hope no less befriends this fear. For never is God seen so glorious, so worthy of all our devotedness to him as when we hope in his mercy; and even the more assured we are of his regard, the more we shall enquire, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? The more we shall tremble at the thought of offending and grieving him, the more we shall continue upon our knees praying, &quot;Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>Strength and <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>Redeemer.&quot; It is called &quot; a lively hope :&quot; and Christians know, by experience, that upon all their principles and duties it has the same influence as Spring has upon the fields and the gardens.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jay. </span></p>

How sweet, how purifying, how perfuming: If men&#39;s mouths were always thus filled, there would be no repining against God, or slander of neighbours.

The exultation of this verse is no mere tongue bragging, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul</span>&quot; is in it, the boasting is meant and felt before it is expressed. what scope there is for holy boasting in Jehovah! His person, attributes, covenant, promises, works, and a thousand things besides, are all incomparable, unparalleled, matchless; we may cry them up as we please, but we shall never be convicted of vain and empty speech in so doing. Truly he who writes these words of comment has nothing of his own to boast of, but much to lament over, and yet none shall stop him of his boast in God so long as he lives. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>humble </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thereof, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glad.&quot; </span>They are usually grieved to hear boastings: they turn aside from vauntings and lofty speeches, but boasting in the Lord is quite another matter; by this the most lowly are consoled and encouraged. The confident expressions of tried believers are a rich solace to their brethren of less experience. We ought to talk of the Lord&#39;s goodness on purpose that others may be confirmed in their trust in a faithful God.</p>

If so it is most fitting. Who can make God great but those who feel themselves to be little? He bids them help him to make the Lord&#39;s fame greater among the sons of men. Jehovah is infinite, and therefore cannot really be made greater, but his name grows in manifested glory as he is made known to his creatures, and thus he is said to be magnified. It is well when the soul feels its own inability adequately to glorify the Lord, and therefore stirs up others to the gracious work; this is good both for the man himself and for his companions. No praise can excel that which lays us prostrate under a sense of our own nothingness, while divine grace like some topless Alp rises before our eyes, and sinks us lower and lower in holy awe. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>together.&quot; </span>Social, congregated worship is the outgrowth of one of the natural instincts of the new life.
