He seems to say, I make a full confession of them. Not that this is my plea in seeking forgiveness, but it is a clear evidence that I need mercy, and am utterly unable to look to any other quarter for help. My pleading guilty has barred me from any appeal against the sentence of justice: O Lord, I must cast myself on thy mercy, refuse me not, I pray thee. Thou hast made me willing to confess. o follow up this work of grace, with a full and free remission! <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>My sin as a whole is never out of my mind; it continually oppresses my spirit. I lay it before <sub>(</sub>thee because it is ever before me: Lord, put it away both from thee and me. To an awakened conscience, pain on account of sin is not transient and occasional, but intense and permanent, and this is no sign of divine wrath, but rather a sure preface of abounding favour.</p>

All his wrong-doing centred, culminated, and came to a climax, at the foot of the divine throne. To injure our fellow men is sin, mainly because in so doing we violate the law of God. The penitent&#39;s heart was so filled with a sense of the wrong done to the Lord himself, that all other confession was swallowed up in a broken-hearted acknowledgment of offence against him. <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&#39;&#39;</sup>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>done </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evil </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sight.&quot; </span>To commit treason in the very court of the king and before his eye is impudence indeed: David felt that his sin was committed in all its filthiness while Jehovah himself looked on. None but a child of God cares for the eye of God, but where there is grace in the soul it reflects a fearful guilt upon every evil act, when we remember that the God whom we offend was present when the trespass was committed. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mightesl</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>justified </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>speakest, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>clear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>when </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>judgest.&quot; </span>He could not present any argument against divine justice, if it proceeded at once to condemn him and punish him for his crime. IIis own confession, and the judge&#39;s own witness of the whole transaction, placed the transgression beyond all question or debate; the iniquity was indisputably committed, and was unquestionably a foul wrong, and therefore the course of justice was clear and beyond all controversy.</p>

This was not intended to justify himself, but it rather meant to complete the confession. It is as if he said, not only have I sinned this once, but I am in my very nature a sinner. The fountain of my life is polluted as well as its streams. My birth-tendencies are out of the square of equity; I naturally lean to forbidden thing<sup>&#39;</sup>!. Mine is a constitutional disease, rendering my very person obnoxious to thy wrath. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>did </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mother </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>conceive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>He goes back to the earliest moment of his being, not to traduce his mother, but to acknowledge the deep tap-roots of his sin. It is a wicked wresting of Scripture to deny that original sin and natural depravity are here taught. Surely men who cavil at this doctrine have need to be taught of the Holy Spirit what be the first principles of the faith. David&#39;s mother was the Lord&#39;s handmaid, he was born in chaste wedlock, of a good father, and he was himself &quot; the man after God&#39;s own heart;&quot; and yet his nature was as fallen as that of any other son of Adam, and there only needed the occasion for the manifesting of that sad fact. In our shaping we were put out of shape, and when we were conceived our nature conceived sin. Alas, for poor humanity! Those who will may cry it up, but he is most blessed who in his own soul has learned to lament his lost estate.</p>

He cares not for the pretence of purity, he looks to the mind, heart, and soul. Always has the Holy One of Israel estimated men by their inner nature, and not by their outward professions; to him the inward is as visible as the outward, and he rightly judges that the essential character of an action lies in the motive of him who works it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hidden </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>part </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><i>shalt </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>make </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wisdom.&quot; </span>The penitent feels that God is teaching him truth concerning his nature, which he had not before perceived. The love of the heart, the mystery of its fall, and the way of its purification&#8212;this hidden wisdom we must all attain ; and it is a great blessing to be able to believe that the Lord will &quot; make us to know it.&quot; No one can teach our innermost nature but the Lord, but he can instruct us to profit. The Holy Spirit can write the law on our heart, and that is the sum of practical wisdom. He can put the fear of the Lord within, and that is the beginning of wisdom. He can reveal Christ in us, and he is essential wisdom. Such poor, foolish, disarranged souls as ours, shall yet be ordered aright, and truth and wisdom shall reign within us.</span></p>

Let the sin-offering purge my sin. Let him who was appointed to atone, execute his sacred office on me; for none can need it more than I. The passage may be read as the voice of faith as well as a prayer, and so it runs&#8212;&quot; Thou wilt purge me with hyssop, <span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>clean.&quot; </span>Foul as I :im, there is such power in the divine propitiation, that my sin shall vanish quite away.

Considering the nature of the sin, and the deep sense the psalmist had of it, it is a glorious faith to be able to see in the blood sufficient, nay, all-sufficient merit entirely to purge it away. Considering also the deep natural inbred corruption which David saw and experienced within, it is a miracle of faith that he could rejoice in the hope of perfect purity in his inward parts. Yet, be it added, the faith is no more than the word warrants, than the blood of atonement encourages, than the promise of God deserves. O that some reader may take heart, even now while smarting under sin, to do the Lord the honour to rely thus confidently on the finished sacrifice of Calvary and the infinite mercy there revealed.</p>

Pardon from God would give him double joy&#8212;&quot; joy and gladness.&quot; No stinted bliss awaits the forgiven one; he shall not only <span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span>a double-blooming joy, but he shall <span style='font-style:italic;'>hear </span>it; it shall sing with exultation.

He groaned under no mere flesh wounds; his firmest and yet tenderest powers were &quot;broken in pieces all asunder;&quot; his manhood had become a dislocated, mangled, quivering sensibility. Yet if he who crushed would cure, every wound would become a new mouth for song, every bone quivering before with agony would become equally sensible of intense delight. The figure is bold, and so is the supplicant. He is requesting a great thing; he seeks joy for a sinful heart, music for crushed bones. Preposterous prayer anywhere but at the throne of God! Preposterous there most of all but for the cross where Jehovah Jesus bore our sins in his own body on the tree. A penitent need not ask to be an hired servant, or settle down in despairing content with perpetual mourning; he may ask for gladness and he shall have it; for if when prodigals return the father is glad, and the neighbors and friends rejoice and are merry with music and dancing, what need can there be that the restored one himself should be wretched?</span></p>

David&#39;s face was ashamed with looking on his sin, and no diverting thoughts could remove it from his memory; but he prays the Lord to do with his sin, what he himself cannot.

Such influences will not enslave but emancipate us; for holiness is liberty, and the Holy Spirit is a tree Spirit. In the roughest and most treacherous ways we are safe with such a keeper; in the best paths we stumble if left to ourselves. The praying for joy and upholding go well together; it is all over with joy if the foot is not kept; and, on the other hand, joy is a very upholding thing, and greatly aids holiness; meanwhile, the free, noble, royal Spirit is at the bottom of both.</p>

&quot;a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.&quot; If unworthy to edify saints, he would creep in along with the sinners, and humbly tell them of divine love. The mercy of God to one is an illustration of his usual procedure, so that our own case helps us to understand his &quot;ways,&quot; or his general modes of action: perhaps, too, David under that term refers to the preceptive part of the word of God, which, having broken, and having suffered thereby, he felt that he could vindicate and urge upon the reverence of other offenders. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><i>waivers </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>converted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>My fall shall be the restoration of others.

Besides, his sin of adultery was a capital offence, and he puts himself down as one worthy to die the death. Honest penitents do not fetch a compass and confess their sins in an elegant periphrasis, but they come to the point, call a spade a spade, and make a clean breast of all.

He confesses sin more plainly in this verse than before, and yet he deals with God more confidently: growing upward and downward at the same time are perfectly consistent.

After all, it is the righteousness of divine mercy which is its greatest wonder. Note how David would preach in the last verse, and now here he would sing. We can never do too much for the Lord to whom we owe more than all. If we could be preacher, precentor, doorkeeper, pewopener, footwasher, and all in one, all would be too little to show forth all our gratitude. A great sinner pardoned makes a great singer. Sin has a loud voice, and so should our thankfulness have. We shall not sing our own praises if we be saved, but our theme will be the Lord our righteousness, in whose merits we stand righteously accepted.</p>

How marvellously the Lord can open our lips, and what divine things can we poor simpletons pour forth under his inspiration! This prayer of a penitent is a golden petition for a preacher, Lord, I offer it for myself and my brethren.

He felt he had hindered the project of honouring the Lord there as he desired, but he prayed God still to let the place of his ark be glorious, and to establish his worship and his worshipping people. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Build </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walls </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jerusalem.&quot; </span>This had been one of David&#39;s schemes, to wall in the holy city, and he desires to see it completed; but we believe he had a more spiritual meaning, and prayed for the prosperity of the Lord&#39;s cause and people. He had done mischief by his sin, and had, as it were, pulled down her walls ; he, therefore, implores the Lord to undo the evil, and establish his church. God can make his cause to prosper, and in answer to prayer he will do so. Without his building we labour in vain; therefore are we the more instant and constant in prayer. There is surely no grace in us if we do not feel for the church of God, and take a lasting interest in its welfare.</p>

A saved soul expects to see its prayers answered in a revived church, and then is assured that God will be greatly glorified. Though we bring no more sacrifices for sin, yet as priests unto God our solemn praises and votive gifts are thank offerings acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. We bring not the Lord our least things&#8212;our doves and pigeons; but we present him with our best possessions&#8212;our bullocks. We are glad that in this present time we are able to fulfil in person the declaration of this verse: we also, forecasting the future, wait for days of the divine presence, when the church of God, with unspeakable joy, shall offer gifts upon the altar of God, which will far eclipse anything beheld in these less enthusiastic days. Hasten it, O Lord.</p>

Although, therefore, I leave it to others to go according to their own interpretations, yet I have a good hope that I shall be enabled to give the true and genuine meaning of the text. This, then, I would first of all advise the reader to do&#8212;to bear in mind that which I observed at the beginning of the Psalm, that David is here speaking in the person of all the saints, and not in his own person only, not in his own person as an adulterer. Although I do not say it might not be, that it was this fall which, as a medium, brought him under the knowledge of himself and of his whole human nature, and made him think thus: &quot;Behold ! I, so holy a king, who have with so much pious devotedness observed the law and the worship of God, have been so tempted and overcome by the inbred evil and sin of my flesh, that I have murdered an innocent man, and have for adulterous purposes taken away his wife! And is not this an evident proof that my nature is more deeply infected and corrupted by sin than ever I thought it was? I who was yesterday chaste am to-day an adulterer! I who yesterday had hands innocent of blood, am to-day a man of blood-guiltiness!&quot; And it might be that in this way he derived the feeling sense of his entire sinfulness, from his fall into adultery and murder, and from thence drew his conclusion &#8212;that neither the tree nor the fruits of human nature were good, but that the whole was so deformed and lost by sin, that there was nothing sound left in the whole of nature. This I would have the reader bear in mind, first of all, if he desire to have the pure meaning of this passage. In the next place, the grammatical construction is to be explained, which seems to be somewhat obscure. For what the translator has rendered by the <span style='font-style:italic;'>preterj/erfect, </span>ought to be the <span style='font-style:italic;'>present</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>only </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>do </span><i>I </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>&quot; that is. I know that before thee I am nothing but a sinner; or, before thee I do nothing but evil continually ; that is, my whole life is evil and depraved on account of sin. I cannot boast before thee of merit or of righteousness, but am evil altogether, and in thy sight this is my character&#8212;I do evil. I have sinned, I do sin, and shall sin to the end of the chapter.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Martin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luther. </span></p>

But is it not that these actions of David were great wrongs indeed, and enormous iniquities against Uriah; but can we properly say they were <span style='font-style:italic;'>sins </span>against Uriah? For what is sin, but a transgression of God&#39;s law? And how then can sin be committed against any but against him only whose law we transgress? Or is it, that it may justly be said, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>only </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sinned,&quot; </span>because against others perhaps in a base <span style='font-style:italic;'>tenure, </span>yet only against God in <span style='font-style:italic;'>capitet </span>Or is it, that David might justly say to God, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Against </span><i>thee </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>only </span>have I sinned;&quot; because from others he might appeal, as being a king and having no superior; but no appealing from God, as being King of kings and supreme Lord over all?

If you fall with them into the several commandments, they will be ready to discover a conceit that there is scarce one that they arc faulty in. In the first commandment they acknowledge no God but one; in the second, they do not worship images ; in the third, they swear as little as any, and never but for the truth; in the fourth, they keep their church on Sundays as well as most; in the second table, there is neither treason, nor murder, nor theft, nor whoredom, nor the like gross sin, but concerning it they are ready to protest their innoccur.y.

For how can a judge pass the bounds of equity where the delinquent hath passed all bounds of iniquity? and what error can there be in thy being severe when the greatness of my fault is a justification of severity&#39;? That thou canst not lay so heavy a doom upon me, which I have not deserved? Thou canst not pronounce so hard a sentence against me, which I am not worthy of.

He therefore knew God beheld it sufficiently; but he utters it afore God, or, as spoken of himself between God and himself, thereby to express his own astonishment and amazement at the sight and conviction of this corruption, and at the sight of what a monster he saw himself to be in the sight of God in respect of this sin.

Since we must take human nature as it is, and if it be really in a state of disorder and corruption, and cannot be otherwise, considering the common law of its production, the difficulty must have been as ancient as the first man that was born ; and therefore can be no objection against the truth of revelation, but it must be equally so against natural religion, which must equally allow the thing, if it be in reality a fat t, with revelation itself.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Chandler. </span></p>

The prophet speaketh according to his own feeling and present judgment of himself, as though he had lost all, and had no goodness in himself. No doubt the prophet&#39;s heart was in part clean, though not so much as he desired. These things thus opened, here cometh a question first to be answered. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Quest. </span>Whether David could have lost the cleanness of heart, having once had it? <span style='font-style:italic;'>Ans. </span>No. The gifts and calling of God, that is (as I take it), the gifts of effectual calling, are such as God never repenteth of or taketh away. Faith, hope, and charity are abiding gifts, as sure as the election of God, which is unchangeable. Indeed, the children of God, if we only considered them in themselves with their enemies, might fall away, but being founded upon the unchangeable nature of God, and immutability of his counsel, they cannot, the gates of hell shall not prevail against them, the elect cannot be deceived or plucked out of Christ&#39;s hands. Nay, certain it is that David did not actually leave his former cleanness. For sure it is, his heart smiting him (as here it did), so doing before in less matters, it was not wholly void of cleanness. And again, it could not pray for cleanness if it were not somewhat clean. This is most sure, that by grievous sins much filthiness cometh to the soul, as by a boisterous wind a tree may lose his leaves and some branches, so as that the party sinning may be brought into as great passions almost as if he had lost all, but the desire of grace is an infallible certainty of some grace of that kind. The prophet therefore desireth not a clean heart because he had it not in any sort, but because he could not so well perceive it in himself, and take such comfort in it as he had done before, and for that he desired it a great deal more than now he had it.

Whereof we learn this is one of the just punishments of sin; it procures the casting out of a man from the face of God; and it may let us see how dear bought are the pleasures of sin when a man to enjoy the face of the creature deprives himself of the comfortable face of the Creator; as David here, for the carnal love of the face of Bathsheba, puts himself in danger to be cast out forever from the presence of the Lord his God. If a man could remember this in all Satan&#39;s temptations, what it is that the deceiver offers, and what it is again that he seeks, he would be loth to buy the perishing pleasures of sin upon such a price as Satan selleth them, but would answer him as the apostle did Simon Magus, &quot;Thy money, with thyself, go into perdition ;&quot; thy gain, thy glory, thy pleasure, and whatever thou wouldst give me to offend the Lord my God, go with thyself into perdition, for what canst thou offer unto me comparable to that which thou wouldst steal from me?</p>

The contrary is clearly declared by Peter, who tells us that the word by which we are born again is an incorruptible seed (1 Peter i. 23.); and John is equally explicit in informing us that the elect are preserved from falling away altogether. 1 John iii. 9. However much they may appear for a time to have been cast off by God, it is afterwards seen that grace must have been alive in their breasts even during that interval when it seemed to be extinct. Nor is there any force in the objection that David speaks as if he feared that he might be deprived of the Spirit. It is natural that the saints, when they have fallen into sin, and have thus done what they could to expel the grace of God, should feel an anxiety upon this point; but it is their duty to hold fast the truth, that grace is the incorruptible seed of God, which never can perish in any heart where it has been deposited. This is the spirit displayed by David. Reflecting upon his offence, he is agitated with fears, and yet rests in the persuasion that, being a child of God, he would not be deprived of what, indeed, he had justly forfeited.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

That God whom thou hast to deal with is very gracious; what thou hast lost he is ready to restore (the evidence of thy grace I mean). David begged this, and obtained it. Yea, saith faith, if it were true what thou fearest, that thy grace was never true, there is mercy enough in God&#39;s heart to pardon all thy former hypocrisy if thou comest in the sincerity of thy heart; aud so faith persuades the soul by an act of adventure to cast itself upon God in Christ. Wilt not thou, saith faith, expect to find as much mercy at God&#39;s hands, as thou canst look for at a man&#39;s? It is not beyond the line of created mercy to forgive many unkindnesses, much falseness and unfaithfulness, upon an humble, sincere acknowledgment of the same. The world is not so bad but it abounds with parents who can do thus much for their children, and masters for their servants; and is that hard for God to do which is so easy in his creature? Thus faith vindicates God&#39;s name.

This duty Christ craved from Peter : &quot;And thou, when thou art converted, confirm thy brethren.&quot; And this duty, as David here promiseth, so we may read how he did perform it: &quot;Come unto me, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what he hath done for my soul.&quot; The property of a Christian is, <span style='font-style:italic;'>fides </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>per </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>delectionem </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>etficax, </span>faith worked by love. What availeth it to pretend faith toward God, where there is no love toward thy neighbour? and wherein can thy love be declared more than in this, to draw thy neighbour to the participation of that same merit whereunto God hath called thee? By the law a man was bound to bring home his neighbour&#39;s wandering beast if he had met with it before; how much more, then, to turn again his neighbour himself when he wanders from the Lord his God? If two men walking on the way should both fall into one pit, and the one being relieved out of it should go his way and forget his neighbour, might it not justly be called a barbarous and inhuman cruelty? We have all fallen into one and the same mire of iniquity; since the Lord hath put out his merciful hand to draw us out of this prison of sin, shall we refuse to put out our hand to see if possibly we may draw up our brethren with us ?&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cowper </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(Bishop). </span></p>

No particular sacrifices were appointed by the law of Moses to expiate the guilt of murder and adultery. The person who had perpetrated these crimes was, according to the divine law, to be punished with death. David therefore may be understood as declaring, that it was utterly vain for him to think of resorting to sacrifices and burnt-offerings with a view to the expiation of his guilt ; that his criminality was of such a character, that the ceremonial law made no provision for his deliverance from the doom which his deeds of horror deserved ; and that the only sacrifices which would avail were those mentioned in the succeeding verse, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sacrifices </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>broken </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

But why should I offer him that he cares not for? my heart, I know, he cares for; and if it be broken, and offered up by penitence and contrition, it is the only sacrifice that now he delights in. But can we think God to be so indifferent that he will accept of a broken heart? Is a thing that is broken good for anything? Can we drink in a broken glass? Or can we lean upon a broken staff? But though other things may be the worse for breaking, yet a heart is never at the best till it be broken; for till it be broken we cannot see what is in it; till it be broken, it cannot send forth its sweetest odour; and therefore, though God loves a whole heart in affection, yet he loves a broken heart in sacrifice. And no marvel, indeed, seeing it is he himself that breaks it ; for as nothing but goat&#39;s blood can break the adamant, so nothing but the blood of our scape-goat, Jesus Christ, is able to break our adamantine hearts. Therefore, accept, O God, my broken heart, which I offer thee with a whole heart; seeing thou canst neither</p>

Neither the walls of Jerusalem, nor the buildings of Zion, as the royal palace and the magnificent structure of the temple, which we know David had already contemplated for the worship of God (2 Samuel vii. 1, etc.), were completed during his reign.

Honourable titles are but irony where the wearer is mean and cruel.
