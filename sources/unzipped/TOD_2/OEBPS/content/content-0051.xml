Note how incessant was their jeer, and how artfully they framed it! It cut the good man to the bone to have the faithfulness of his God impugned. They had better have thrust needles into his eyes than have darted insinuations against his God. Shimei may here be alluded to who after this fashion mocked David as he fled from Absalom. He roundly asserted that David was a bloody man, and that God was punishing him for supplanting Saul and his house; his wish was father to his thought. The wicked know that our worst misfortune would be to lose God&#39;s favour, hence their diabolical malice leads them to declare that such is the case. Glory be to God, they lie in their throats, for our God is in the heavens, ay, and in the furnace too, succouring his people.</p>

God hidden, and foes raging, a pair of evils enough to bring down the stoutest heart! Yet why let reflections so gloomy engross us, since the result is of no value : merely to turn the soul on itself, to empty it from itself into itself is useless, how much better to pour out the heart before the Lord! The prisoner&#39;s treadwheel might sooner land him in the skies than mere inward questioning raise us nearer to consolation. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>had </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gone </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>multitude, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>went </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><i>God.&quot; </i>Painful reflections were awakened by the memory of past joys; he had mingled in the pious throng, their numbers had helped to give him exhilaration and to awaken holy delight, their company had been a charm to him as with them he ascended the hill of Zion. Gently proceeding with holy ease, in comely procession, with frequent strains of song, he and the people of Jehovah had marched in reverent ranks up to the shrine of sacrifice, the dear abode of peace and holiness. Far away from such goodly company the holy man pictures the sacred scene and dwells upon the details of the pious march. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>With </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>voice </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>joy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>multitude </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>kept </span><i>holy </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>day.</span>&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> The festive noise is in his ears, and the solemn dance before his eyes. Perhaps he alludes to the removal of the ark and to the glorious gatherings of the tribes on that grand national holy day and holiday. How changed his present place! For Zion, a wilderness; for the priests in white linen, soldiers in garments of war; for the song, the&#39;sneer of blasphemy; for the festivity, lamentation; for joy in the Lord, a mournful dirge over his absence.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA301.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated' id='para.316.1.2.box.579.1555.564.110.q.50'>&quot;I sigh to think of happier days <br/>   When thou, O God, wast nigh, <br/> When every heart was tuned to praise; <br/>   And none more blest than I.&quot; <br/></p>

What a degradation to supplant the intelligent song of the whole congregation by the theatrical prettinesses of a quartett, the refined niceties of a choir, or the blowing off of wind from inanimate bellows and pipes! We might as well pray by machinery as praise by it.</p>

His faith reasons with his fears, his hope argues with his sorrows. These present troubles, are they to last for ever? The rejoicings of my foes, are they more than empty talk? My absence from the solemn feasts, is that a perpetual exile? Why this deep depression, this faithless fainting, this chicken-hearted melancholy? As Trapp says, &quot;David chideth David out of the dumps;&quot; and herein he is an example for all desponding ones.<a id='GBS.PA302.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.317.1.0.box.236.298.1297.1097.q.60'>
To search out the cause of our sorrow is often the best surgery for grief. Selfignorance is not bliss; in this case it is misery. The mist of ignorance magnifies the causes of our alarm; a clearer view will make monsters dwindle into trifles. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Why </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>disquieted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>within </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>meV </span>Why is my quiet gone? If I cannot keep a public Sabbath, yet wherefore do I deny my soul her indoor Sabbath? Why am I agitated like a troubled sea, and why do my thoughts make a noise like a tumultuous, multitude? The causes are not enough to justify such utter yielding to despondency. Up, my heart! What aileth thee? Play the man, and thy castings down shall turn to liftings up, and thy disquietudes to calm. <i>&quot;Hope </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God.&quot; </span>If every evil be let loose from Pandora&#39;s box, yet is there hope at the bottom. This is the grace that swims, though the waves roar and be troubled. God is unchangeable, and therefore his grace is the ground for unshaken hope. If everything be dark, yet the day will come, and meanwhile hope carries stars in her eyes; her lamps are not dependent upon oil from without, her light is fed by secret visitations of God, which sustain the spirit. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span>him.&quot; Yet will my sighs give place to songs, my mournful ditties shall be exchanged for triumphal preans. A loss of the present sense of God&#39;s love is not a loss of that love itself; the jewel is there, though it gleams not on our breast; hope knows her title good when she cannot read it clear; she expects the promised boon though present providence stands before her with empty hands. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>yet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>help </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>countenance.&quot; </span>Salvations come from the propitious face of God, and he will yet lift up his countenance upon us. Note well that the main hope and chief desire of David rest in the smile of God. His face is what he seeks and hopes to see, and this will recover his low spirits, this will put to scorn his laughing enemies, this will restore to him all the joys of those holy and happy days around which memory lingers. This is grand cheer. This verse, like the singing of Paul and Silas, looses chains and shakes prison walls. He who can use such heroic language in his gloomy hours will surely conquer. In the garden of hope grow the laurels for future victories, the roses of coming joy, the lilies of approaching peace.</span></p>

visible panting; the sorrow was now all restrained within doors. Within or upon himself he was cast down ; and, verily, it may well be so, while our thoughts look more within than upward. If self were to furnish comfort, we should have but poor provender. There is no solid foundation for comfort in such fickle frames as our heart is subject to. It is well to tell the Lord how we feel, and the more plain the confession the better: David talks like a sick child to its mother, and we should learn to imitate him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Therefore </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>remember </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>&#39;Tis well to fly to our God.

It is great wisdom to store up in memory our choice occasions&#39;of converse with heaven ; we may want them another day, when the Lord is slow in bringing back his banished ones, and our soul is aching with fear. *&#39; His love in times past&quot; has been a precious cordial to many a fainting one; like soft breath it has fanned the smoking flax into a flame, and bound up the bruised reed. Oh, never-to-be-forgotten valley of Achor, thou art a door of hope! Fair days, now gone, ye have left a light behind you which cheers our present gloom. Or does David mean that even where he was he would bethink him of his God ; does he declare that, forgetful of time and place, he would count Jordan as sacred as Siloa, Hermon as holy as Zion, and even Mizar, that insignificant rising ground, as glorious as the mountains which are round about Jerusalem! Oh ! it is a heavenly heart which can sing&#8212;</span></p>

As in a waterspout, the deeps above and below clasp hands, so it seemed to David that heaven and earth united to create a tempest around him. His woes were incessant and overwhelming. Billow followed billow, one sea echoed the roaring of another; bodily pain aroused mental fear, Satanic suggestions chimed in with mistrustful forebodings, outward tribulation thundered in awful harmony with inward anguish : .his soul seemed drowned as in a universal deluge of trouble, over whose waves the providence of the Lord moved as a watery pillar, in dreadful majesty inspiring the utmost terror. As for the afflicted one, he was like a lonely bark around which the fury of a storm is bursting, or a mariner floating on a mast, almost every moment submerged. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;All </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waves </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>billows </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gone </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>over </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>David thought that every trouble in the world had met in him, but he exaggerated, for <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>the breaking wazes of Jehovah have passed over none but the Lord Jesus; there are griefs to which he makes his children strangers for his love&#39;s sake. Sorrow naturally states its case forcibly; the mercy is that the Lord after all hath not dealt with us according to our fears. Yet what a plight to be in! Atlantic rollers sweeping in ceaseless succession over one&#39;s head, waterspouts coming nearer and nearer, and all the ocean in uproar around the weary swimmer; most of the heirs of heaven can realise the description, for they have experienced the like. This is a deep experience unknown to babes in grace, but common enough to such as do business on great waters of affliction : to such it is some comfort to remember that the waves and billows are the Lord&#39;s, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span>waves and <span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span>billows,&quot; says David, they are all sent, and directed by him, and achieve his designs, and the child of God knowing this, is the more resigned.</p>

If the Lord be indeed our refuge, when we find no refuge, it is time to be raising the question, &quot;Why is this?&quot; Yet we must not let go our hold, the Lord must be &quot; <i>my&quot; </i>rock still ; we must keep to him as our alone confidence, and never forego our interest in him. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Why </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>go </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mourning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>because </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>oppression </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemy?&quot; </span>He who condescends to be pleaded with by Abraham, his friend, allows us to put to him the question that we may search out the causes of his severity towards us. Surely he can have no pleasure in seeing the faces of his servants stained and squalid with their tears; he can find no content in the harshness with which their foes assail them. He can never take pleasure in the tyranny with which Satan vexes them. Why then does he leave them to be mocked by his enemies and theirs? How can the strong God, who is as firm and abiding as a rock, be also as hard and unmoved as a rock towards those who trust in him? Such enquiries humbly pressed often afford relief to the soul. To know the reason for sorrow is in part to know how to escape it, or at least to endure it. Want of attentive consideration often makes adversity appear to be more mysterious and hopeless than it really is. It is a pitiable thing for any man to have a limb amputated, but when we know that the operation was needful to save life, we are glad to hear that it has been successfully performed ; even thus as trial unfolds, the design of the Lord in sending it becomes far more easy to bear.</p>

One is that they sprang from some one of that name in the days of David. Mudge and others think that the sons of Korah were a society of musicians, founded or presided over by Korah. Others think that the sons of Korah were the surviving descendants of that miserable man who, together with two hundred and fifty of his adherents, who were princes, perished when &quot;the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, together with Korah.&quot;&#39; In Numbers xxvi. 11, we read: &quot;Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.&quot; They had taken the warning given, and had departed from the tents of these wicked men. Numbers xvi. 24, 26. It must be admitted that the name <span style='font-style:italic;'>Korah </span>and the patronymic <span style='font-style:italic;'>Korahite </span>are found in the Scriptures in a way that creates considerable doubt respecting the particular man from whom the Korahites are named. See 1 Chron. i. 35 ; ii. 43 ; vi. 22, 54; ix. 19; xxvi. 1 ; 2 Chron. xx. 19. Yet the more common belief is that they descended from him who perished for his gainsaying. This view is taken by Ainsworth with entire confidence, by Gill, and others. Korah, who perished, was a Levite. Whatever may have been their origin, it is clear <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sons </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Korah </span>were a Leviticnl family of singers.

Numbers xvi. We find his descendants existing as a powerful Levitical family in the time of David, at least, if they are to be identified, as is probable, with the Korahites mentioned in I Chron. xii. 6, who, like our own warlike bishops of former times, seem to have known how to doff the priestly vestment for the soldier&#39;s armour, and whose hand could wield the sword as well as strike the harp. The Korahites were apart of the band who acknowledged David as their chief, at Ziklag; warriors &quot; whose faces,&quot; it is said, &quot; were like the faces of lions, and who were (for speed) like gazelles upon the mountains.&quot; According to 1 Chron. ix. 17&#8212;19, the Korahites were in David&#39;s time, keepers of the threshold of the tabernacle; and still earlier, in the time of Moses, watchmen at the entrance of the camp of the Levites. In 1 Chron. xxvi. 1&#8212;19, we find two branches of this family associated with that of Merari, as guardians of the doors of the Temple. There is probably an allusion to this their office, in Psalm lxxxiv. 10. But the Korahites were also celebrated musicians and singers; see 1 Chron. vi. 16&#8212;33, where Heman, one of the three famous musicians of the time, is said to be a Korahite (comp. 1 Chron. xxv).

Accordingly Bernard speaks, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Nunquam </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ahs </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>te </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>absque </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>te </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>recedam </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Domine: </span>I will never depart (in duty) from thee without thee, Lord. Augustine said he loved not Tully&#39;s elegant orations (as formerly) because he could not find <span style='font-style:italic;'>Christ </span>in them: nor doth a gracious soul love empty duties. Rhetorical flowers and flourishes, expressions without impiessions in praying or preaching, are not true bread, but a tinkling cymbal to it, and it cannot be put off with the empty spoon of aery notions, or lovely (that are not also lively) songs: if Christ t.ilk with you in the way (of dutv) your heart will burn within you.

Had I never heard of heaven I could not have been so miserable as I now amI had I never known God, the loss of him had not been so terrible as now it is like to be.

A hopeless soul is clamorous: one while it chargeth God, another while it reviles his instruments. It cannot long iest, and no wonder, when hope is not there. Hope hath a rare art in stilling a froward spirit, when nothing else can; as the mother can make the crying thild quiet by laying it to the breast, when the rod makes it cry worse. This way David took, and found it effectual; when his soul was unquiet by reason of his present affliction, he lays it to the breast of the promise: &quot;Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God.&quot; And here his soul sweetly sleeps, as the child with the breast in his mouth ; and that this was his usual way, we may think by the frequent instances we find; thrice we find him</p>

It should seem that they are occasioned by the congregating of great masses of cloud, whose waters concentrating to a point, pour themselves down in a tremendous column&#39;, accompanied with a roaring noise. Now, the image conceived in the mind of the psalmist seems to be that of the rushing of this vast waterspout down into the sea, already agitated, and increasing the turbulence and disorder of its waves. An awful picture! Especially if there be added to it the ideas of a black tempestuous sky, and the deafening roar occasioned by the tumult. What would be the situation of a vessel in the midst of such a tempest, the deluge pouring down from above, and all around her the furious ocean heaving its tremendous surges&#8212;how ungovernable, how helpless, how next to impossible that she should escape foundering except by some almost miraculous interference!

These remarkable phenomena occur most frequently in spring, but I have also seen them in autumn. They are not accompanied with much rain; and between the dark stratum above and the sea, the sky is clear and bright. Here and there fragments of black vapour, shaped like long funnels, are drawn down from the clouds towards the sea, and are seen to be in violent agitation, whirling around on themselves as they are driven along by the wind. Directly beneath them, the surface of the sea is also in commotion by a whirlwind, which travels on in concert with the spout above. I have often seen the two actually unite in midair, and rush toward the mountains, writhing, and twisting, and bending, like a huge serpent, with its head in the clouds and its tail on the deep.</p>

Job. xxxv. 10. In the <span style='font-style:italic;'>daytime </span>the soul is so taken up with base employments, so distracted with variety of sensible objects, and so busied with work for the body, that either she hath no leisure at all to do her own work (such as this joy is as much as anything) or she cannot do it so well as she would, or so well as she could <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>night, </span>when she hath less to do.

But, as Peter said of those upon whom the Holy Ghost fell, &quot;These men are not drunk, as ye suppose;&quot; so may I reply to such men, No such matter, the godly are not mad, as ye suppose, for their songs are not works of their own fancy, not made of their own head, but set for them by God himself, &quot;who giveth songs in the night.&quot; Job xxxv. 10.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Zachary </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ifogan. </span></span></p>

At such seasons much of the joy that is felt may be merely natural, as David&#39;s would probably be when rescued from that corroding care which injures the body as well as distresses the soul. There is danger of mistaking; of supposing it to be all spiritual, and hence of imagining the soul to be in a higher state of grace than it really is, and so, of being imperceptibly drawn into a state of false security. There is then especial need of that prayer. &quot;Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.&quot; And with some peculiarly, who being of a sanguine constitution of mind, are in times of enjoyment, soon puffed up and brought into danger.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>March. </span></p>

The country in which he wandered was mountainous, and he often sought and found shelter on the tops of precipitous rocks, or in their natural hollows or excavated caves. Thus the idea of shelter and defence being associated in his mind with that of a rock, how natural that he should apply the term to God, and when seeking him as his refuge and helper, should address him by that appellation. . . . . &quot;Why <span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forgotten </span>me?&#39;&#39; Not that he supposed he was literally forgotten of God, so as to be given up and abandoned by him; because he had still sufficient trust in his faithfulness to seek him for a refuge, and to hope in his mercy. His expression is to be regarded as the language of feeling, not of judgment. He felt, he seemed, as one forgotten by God. Those visits of love, those manifestations of favour with which he had formerly been indulged, and which then seemed to him to be so many tokens of the divine remembrance, were now withheld, now when, on account of his distress, they appeared so unspeakably more needful and desirable; whence it was that he felt as one forgotten.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>March. </span></p>

We may be armed by this observation against the scandal of opposition&#8212;that if we meet with enemies in the world, we should not be much offended at it; grieve we may, but wonder we need not. Was there ever any that did more good than our Saviour Christ? &quot;He went about doing good.&quot; Acts x. 38.

That that is true of the head must be true in the members. Therefore we should rejoice in our conformity to Christ, if it be in a good cause, that we find enemies and opposition. The devil is not made a Christian yet, and he will never be made good, for he is <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>termino, </span>as we say, he is in his bounds, his nature is immovable; he is in hell in regard of his estate, though he be loose to do mischief.

Enemies, therefore, we must look for, and such enemies as will not conceal their malice neither; for that were something, if they would suffer their malice to boil and concoct in their own hearts, but that will not be, but &quot; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak.<span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;&#8212;Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>SiUies. </span></span></p>

And they will very strangely animate our hopes in God under our sorest troubles and dejections. David had (1) confidence in God; and (2) reasons for it; and (3) skill and a heart to urge them. When he reviewed himself, he saw that his soul was gracious ; and so he knew God valued it. It was bent for praising God ; and so he knew that he should have an opportunity and cause to do it, through some signal favours from him. He had an interest in God; and he would neither lose it nor neglect it, and he had great experience of God&#39;s former mercies, and he would not forget them. And when he thinks on God, then praises must be thought on too, and everything relating to it, and all the divine perfections, within the circumference of his knowledge, must have their fresh remembrances and powerful sense revived upon his own heart.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Matthew </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sylvester </span>(1636&#8212;1708), <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Morning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Exercises.&quot; </span></p>

My heart is clear as to its intent,-and therefore I bring my case before thee, content that thou wilt impartially weigh my character, and right my wrongs. If thou wilt judge, thy acceptance of my conduct will be enough for me ; I can laugh at human misrepresentation if my conscience knows that thou art on my side; thou art the only one I care for; and besides, thy verdict will not sleep, but thou wilt see practical justice done to thy slandered servant. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>plead </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><i>cause </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>an </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ungodly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nation.&quot; </span>One such advocate as the Lord will more than suffice to answer a nation of brawling accusers. When people are ungodly, no wonder that they are unjust; those who are not true to God himself cannot be expected to deal rightly with his people. Hating the King they will not love his subjects. Popular opinion weighs with many, but divine opinion is far more weighty with the gracious few. One good word from God outweighs ten thousand railing speeches of men. He bears a brazen shield before him whose reliance in all things is upon his God; the arrows of calumny fall harmlessly from such a buckler, &quot;O <span style='font-style:italic;'>deliver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deceitful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unjust </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man.&quot; </span>Deceit and injustice are boon companions: he who fawns will not fear to slander. From two such devils none can deliver us but God. His wisdom can outwit the craft of the vilest serpent, and his power can overmatch the most raging lion. Whether this was Doeg or Ahithophel is small matter, such double distilled villains are plentiful, and the only way of dealing with them is to refer the matter to the righteous Judge of all ; if we try to fight them with their own weapons, we shall suffer more serious injury from ourselves than from them.

enemies in better hands, remembering that vengeance belongeth not to thee, but to thy Lord. Turn to him in prayer, crying, &quot;O deliver me,&quot; and ere long you shall publish abroad the remembrance of his salvation.</span></p>

If we reasoned more with the Lord we should have more victories in supplication. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength.&quot; </span>All my strength belongs to thee&#8212;I will not, therefore, use it on my own behalf against my personal foes. All my strength comes from thee, I therefore seek help from thee, who art able to bestow it. All my strength is in thee, I leave therefore this task of combating my foes entirely in thy hands. Faith which leaves such things alone is wise faith. Note the assurance of David, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art,&quot; </span>not I hope and trust so, but I know it is so; we shall find confidence to be our consolation. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Why </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dost </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>off?&quot; </span>Why am I treated as if thou didst loathe me? Am I become an offence unto thee? There are many reasons why the Lord might cast us off, but no reason shall prevail to make him do so. He hath not cast off his people, though he for awhile treats them as cast-offs. Learn from this question that it is well to enquire into dark providences, but we must enquire of God, not of our own fears. He who is the author of a mysterious trial can best expound it to us.</p>

Why wear I the weeds of sorrow on my body, and the lines of grief on my face? Oppression makes a wise man mad; why, Lord, am I called to endure so much of it for so long a time? Here again is a useful question, addressed to the right quarter. The answer will often be because we are saints, and must be made like our Head, and because such sorrow is chastening to the spirit, and yieldeth comfortable fruit. We are not to cross-question the Lord in peevishness, but we may ask of him in humility ; God help us to observe the distinction so as not to sin through stress of sorrow.</p>

Reveal my true character by thy light, and reward me according to thy truthful promise. As the sun darts forth his beams, so does the Lord send forth his favour and his faithfulness towards all his people; and as all nature rejoices in the sunshine, even so the saints triumph in the manifestation of the love and fidelity of their God, which, like the golden sunbeam, lights up even the darkest surroundings with delightful splendour. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lead </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>Be these my star to guide me to my rest.

We seek not light to sin by, nor truth to be exalted by it, but that they may become our practical guides to the nearest communion with God : only such light and truth as are sent us from God will do this, common light is not strong enough to show the road to heaven, nor will mere moral or physical truths assist to the holy hill; but the light of the Holy Spirit, and the truth as it is in Jesus, these are elevating, sanctifying, perfecting; and hence their virtue in leading us to the glorious presence of God. It is beautiful to observe how David&#39;s longing to be away from the oppression of man always leads him to sigh more intensely for communion with God.</p>
