In this verse the psalmist brings forward the gravamen of his charge against the servants of the devil. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>without </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cause&quot;</span>&#8212;without my having injured, assailed, or provoked them; out of their own spontaneous malice <i>&quot;him, </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>net </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pit,&quot; </span>even as men hunt for their game with cunning and deception. Innocent persons have often been ruined by traps set for them, into which they have fallen as guilelessly us beasts which stumble into concealed pits, and are taken as in a net. It is no little thing to be able to feel that the enmity which assails us is undeserved&#8212;uncaused by any wilful offence on our part. Twice does David assert in one verse that his adversaries plotted against him <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;without </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cause.&#39;<sup>1</sup>&#39;&#39; </span>Net-making and pit-digging require time and labour, and both of these the wicked will expend cheerfully if they may but overthrow the people of God. Fair warfare belongs to honourable men, but the assailants of God&#39;s church prefer mean, ungenerous schemes, and so prove their nature and their origin. We must all of us be on our guard, for gins and pitfalls are still the favourite weapons of the powers of evil.</p>

Death enters the persecutor&#39;s house without pausing to knock at the door. The thunderbolt of judgment leaps from its hiding-place, and in one crash the wicked are broken for ever. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>net </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>catch </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>himself</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>very </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>destruction </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><i>fall.&quot; </i>There is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>lex </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>talionis </span>with God which often works most wonderfully. Men set traps and catch their own fingers. They throw up stones, and they fall upon their own heads. How often Satan outwits himself, and burns his fingers with his own coals! This will doubtless be one of the aggravations of hell, that men will torment themselves with what were once the fond devices of their rebellious minds. They curse and are cursed; they kick the pricks and tear themselves; they pour forth floods of fire, and it burns them within and without.</p>

Come, dear reader, have you not been delivered from sin, Satan, and death, and will not you bless the Redeemer? You were poor and weak, but in due time Christ sought you, and set you free. O magnify the Lord to-day, and speak well of his name.</p>

If our dove find no rest for the sole of her foot among our enemies, it shall fly into our bosoms and bring an olive branch of peace in its mouth. How sharp is the contrast all through this Psalm between the righteous and his enemies! We must be earnest to keep the line of demarcation broad and clear.</p>

Oh, but if thy conscience condemn thee not all this while, if that be rectified by the sacred word of God, if thou aim at his glory in pursuing thine own salvation, and side not with the disturbers of the church, go on, good Christian, in the practice of piety, discourage not thyself in thy laudable endeavours, but recount with comfort that the Lord is thy judge (1 Cor. iv. 4), with a <span style='font-style:italic;'>scio </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cut </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>crediderim, </span>&quot;I know whom I have believed.&quot; 2 Tim. i. 12. 2.

Well, have patience awhile, cheer up thy fainting spirits, there is a God that beholdeth the innocency of thy cause, unto whom thou hast liberty to make thy last appeal: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Plead </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cause, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>O </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>uw: </span><i>fight </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fight </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>Or, 3.

We find them chiefly in four Psalms, the seventh, thirty-fifth, sixty-ninth, and one-hundred and ninth, and the imprecations in these form a terrible climax. In the last no less than thirty anathemas have been counted. Are these the mere outbursts of passionate and unsanctified feeling, or are they the legitimate expression of a righteous&#39; indignation? Are they to be excused as being animated by the &quot; spirit of Elias&quot; ? a spirit not unholy indeed, but far removed from the meekness and gentleness of Christ; or are they the stereotyped forms in which the spirit of devotion may utter itself? Are they Jewish only, or may they be Christian also? An uninstructed fastidiousness, it is well known, has made many persons recoil from reading these Psalms at all. Many have found their lips falter when they have been called to join in using them in the congregation, and have either uttered them with bated breath and doubting heart, or have interpreted them in a sense widely at variance with the letter. Some have tried to reconcile them with a more enlightened conscience, by regarding such words not as the expression of a wish, but as the utterance of a prediction; but the Hebrew optative which is distinct enough from the simple future, absolutely forbids this expedient. Others again would see in them expressions which may lawfully be used in the soul&#39;s wrestling against spiritual enemies.

The older dispensation was in every sense a sterner one than the new. The spirit of Elias, though not an evil spirit, was not the spirit of Christ. &quot;The Son of Man came not to destroy men&#39;s lives, but to save them.&quot; Luke ix. 50. And through him his disciples are made partakers of the same spirit. But this was not the spirit of the older economy. The Jewish nation had been trained in a sterner school. It had been steeled and hardened by the discipline which had pledged it to a war of extermination with idolaters; and however necessary such a discipline might be, it would not tend to foster the gentler virtues; it is conceivable how even a righteous man, under it, feeling it to be his bounden duty to root out evil wherever he saw it, and identifying, as he did, his own enemies with the enemies of Jehovah, might use language which to us appears unnecessarily vindictive. To men so trained and taught, what we call &quot; religious toleration,&quot; was a thing not only wrong, but absolutely inconceivable.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA165.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.180.1.2.box.75.894.1294.778.q.60'>It may be quite true that we find revenge forbidden as directly in the Old Testament as in the New, as, for instance, in Lev. xix. 18, &quot;Thou shalt not avenge,&quot; etc., though even there there is a limitation, &quot;against the children of thy people.&quot; And it may be no less true that we find instances of imprecation in the New; as when St. Paul says (2 Tim. iv. 14), &quot;Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works,&quot; or when he exclaims (Acts xxiii. 3), &quot;God will smite thee, thou whited wall;&quot; or, &quot;If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.&quot; But even these expressions are very different from the varied, deliberate, carefully-constructed, detailed anathemas of the Psalms. And our Lord&#39;s denunciations, to which Uengstenberg refers, are in no way parallel. They are not curses upon individuals, but in fact solemn utterances of the great truth, &quot;Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. &quot; But after all, whatever may be said of particular passages, the general tone which runs through the two covenants, is unquestionably different. To deny this is not to honour Moses, but to dishonour Christ. Matt. v. 43; xix. 8. On the other hand, we must not forget that these imprecations are not the passionate longing for personal revenge. The singer undoubtedly sees in his enemies, the enemies of God and his church. They that are not with him are against God. And because the zeal of. God&#39;s bouse even consumes him, he prays that all the doers of iniquity may be rooted out. The indignation therefore is righteous, though it may appear to us wrongly directed, or excessive in its utterance.</p>

How deeply the problem of God&#39;s righteousness exercised their minds, is abundantly evident from numerous places in the Psalms. They longed to see that righteousness manifested. It could be manifested, they thought, only in the evident exaltation of the righteous, and the evident destruction of the wicked here. Hence, with their eye always fixed on temporal recompense, they could even wish and pray for the destruction of the ungodly.

Even in the heats of sudden resentment, he was not apt to be hurried into deeds of revenge. Such being the case, it would certainly have been a strange and unaccountable thing if he had shown himself less the master of his own spirit in poems composed in seasons of retirement and communion with God, especially since these very poems express a keen sense of the heinousness of the sin that has been laid to his charge. He can affirm regarding his implacable enemies, &quot;As forme, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneih for his mother.&quot; Psalm xxxv. 13, 14. &quot;O Lord, my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy) : let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth.&quot; Psalm vii. 3 &#8212;5.

And his brother, Charles the Ninth, who delighted in the blood of the saints, had blood given him to drink, for he was worthy.

My soul, says he, shall rejoice, not in a deliverance of the author of which it is ignorant, but in the salvation of God. To place the matter in a still stronger light, he assigns to his very bones the office of declaring the divine glory. As if not content that his tongue should be employed in this, he applies all the members of his body to the work of setting forth the praises of God. The style of speaking which he employs is hyperbolical, but in this way he shows unfeignedly that his love to God was so strong that he desired to spend his sinews and bones in declaring the reality and truth of his devotion.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cahin. </span></p>

He mentions his soul (verse 9) and all his bones as about to take part in the joy, to indicate that he most heartily and with his whole body was about to rejoice, and that the joy which he would manifest would not be of an ordinary character, but of the highest order, so that each several bone should sing forth the praises of God.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Herman </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Venema, </span>1697&#8212;1787.</p>

Ordinary experience shows us that the intestines have sympathy with our passionate excitements, but we have no consciousness of the bones becoming sympathetically sensitive. The expression therefore is highly poetical, and indicates that the joy intended would be far beyond ordinary and common delight; it would be so profound that even the most callous part of the human frame would partake of it. Doubtless the poetry has a basis of truth in it, for though we may not perceive it, there is most assuredly a true and real sympathy with our mental states in every particle of bone and muscle, as well as in those tender organs which are more apparently affected. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>0. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>H. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>8. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thoughts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>suggested </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>passage </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Biblical </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psychology&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Franz </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Delitzsch. </span></p>

God doth permit it for the good of his people, and thus he fiustrates the hopes of the wicked : they intend evil against the godly, and God disposes of it for good. As Joseph said to his brethren, &quot;You intended evil against me, and God disposed of it for good ;&quot; so we may say to such as falsely slander God&#39;s people, You intended evil against the people of God, but God disposes of it for good. There is fivefold good that God brings out of it to his people. <span style='font-style:italic;'>First, </span>God doth by this means humble them, and brings them to examine what is amiss: so that though they be clear of that crime laid to their charge, yet they will then examine whether there be nothing else amiss betwixt God and them; they will search their hearts, and walk more humbly, and cleave more close to the Lord. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Secondly, </span>God doth by this means bring them oftener upon their knees, to seek unto him, to plead their cause, and to clear their innocency. How oft did the prophet speak unto God when the wicked did falsely accuse him ; how did he make his moan at the throne of grace unto God, beseeching him to plead his cause, and to keep him close in his way, that the wicked might not rejoice at his downfall! So when God&#39;s people see that it is that which the wicked would have, that which is their joy, to see the godly fall into such and such a sin ; then the godly will pray more earnestly with David, Lord, lead me in a right path because of my observers; then they will be earnest with God to keep them from falling into that sin that the wicked desire they might fall into; and this is a second good that comes of it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thirdly, </span>God doth use the reproach of the wicked as a preventing medicine against that crime which the wicked lay to their charge. The godly have unrenewed nature as well as renewed, and if God should leave them never so little to themselves, they are not their own keepers, they might fall into that sin which the wicked lay to their charge: and every godly man and woman may say when they are falsely accused, It is God&#39;s mercy that I did not fall into that sin they lay to my charge. God doth use wicked people&#39;s tongues as a warning against such a sin, that when they see how the wicked joy at a brat of their own hatching, then they consider, if the wicked thus joy without a cause, what would they do if they had just cause? Well, by the help of God this shall be a warning to me for ever to watch against that sin: for the time to come I will pray more against that particular sin than I have done, and watch more against that sin than I have done; through God&#39;s help they shall never have occasion to rejoice over me in that kind. Truly, I verily believe many a child of God can say by experience, I never should have prayed and watched against such a sin so much, had not God used the tongues of the wicked as preventing physic: I knew not my own heart, but that I might have fallen into such and such a sin had not God by this means hedged up my way with thorns; and this is the third good comes of it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Fourthly, </span>God doth by this means exercise the graces of his people by letting them undergo bad report as well as good report: he tries whether they will cleave close to him in all conditions, as Psalm xliv. 15&#8212;17. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Fifthly, </span>God doth by this means teach them how to judge of others when they are falsely accused. For the time to come they will not receive a false report against their neighbour; they will know the truth of a thing before they believe it, and they know how to comfort others in the like condition; and thus God disposes of it for good, and thus God makes the wicked the servant of his people in that very thing which the wicked think to wrong them most in : for he uses the wicked as the rod and wisp, to scour off the rust of their graces and to correct their security; and when the rod hath done its office then it is thrown into the fire : and thus you see how God disposes of the wicked&#39;s false accusations of his people for good.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Zephaniah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Smyth<sup>&#39;</sup></span><span style='font-style:italic;'>s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon, </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Malignant&#39;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Plot,&quot; </span>1G47.</p>

Certainly, if there be any grief that can overcast the perfect joys of the saints in heaven, it is that their names and examples should, to the great dishonour of God, be produced by wicked and sinful men, to countenance their grossest sins and wickednesses. But let such know, that God hath set up these in his church to be monuments of his mercy, to declare to humble and penitent sinners how great sins he can pardon ; yet if any hereupon embolden themselves in sin, instead of being set up as monuments of mercy, God will set them up as pillars of salt.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Ezekiel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hopkins </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(Bishop). </span></p>

Unholiness is clear evidence of ungodliness. Wickedness is the fruit of an atheistic root.

To smooth over one&#39;s own conduct to one&#39;s conscience (which is the meaning of the Hebrew) is to smooth one&#39;s own path to hell. The descent to eternal ruin is easy enough, without making a glissade of it, as self-flatterers do. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Until </span><i>his </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>found </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hateful.&quot; </span>At length he is found out and detested, despite his selfconceit. Rottenness smells sooner or later too strong to be concealed. There is a time when the leprosy cannot be hidden. At last the old house can no longer be propped up, and falls about the tenant&#39;s ears: so there is a limit to B man&#39;s self-gratulation; he is found out amid general scorn, and can no longer keep up the farce which he played so well. If this happen not in this life, the hand of death will let light in upon the coveted character, and expose the sinner to shame and contempt.</p>

Belief in God, like light reveals, and then our sin and evil are perceived ; but wicked men are in the dark, for they cannot see what is so clearly within them und around them that it stares them in the face.</p>

When the heart is so corrupt as to flatter itself, the tongue follows suit. The open sepulchre of the throat reveals the foulness of the inner nature. God-fearing men make a conscience of their words, and if they sin through infirmity they do not invent excuses, or go about to boast of their wickedness: but because wicked men think little of evil and artful speeches, we may be clear that God rules not in their souls. The original by declaring that the words of the wicked are falsehood and deceit is peculiarly strong; as if they were not only false in quality, but actual falseness itself. &quot;<i>he </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>left </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>off </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wise, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>do </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot;&#39; </span>From the good way he has altogether gone aside. Men who fear God proceed from strength to strength in the right path, but godless men soon forsake what little good they once knew. How could men apostatise if they had respect unto the supreme Judge? Is it not because they grow more and more forgetful of God, that in due season they relinquish even that hypocritical reverence of him which in former days they maintained in order to flatter their souls?</p>

His bed is a hot-bed for poisonous weeds. God-fearing men meditate upon God and his service ; but when men turn all their thoughts and inventive faculties towards evil, their godlessness is proved to a demonstration. He hath the devil for his bed-fellow who lies abed and schemes how to sin. God is far from him. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>setteth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>himself </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>way </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good.&quot; </span>When he gets up he resolutely and persistently pursues the mischief which he planned.

He never hates a wrong thing because it is wrong, but he meditates on it, defends it, and practises it.</p>
