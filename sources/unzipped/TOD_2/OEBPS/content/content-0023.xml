None know the pangs of conviction but those who have endured them. The rack, the wheel, the flaming fagot are ease compared with the Tophet which a guilty conscience kindles within the breast: better suffer all the diseases which flesh is heir to, than lie under the crushing sense of the wrath of almighty God. The Spanish inquisition with all its tortures was nothing to the inquest which conscience holds within the heart.</p>

Under terrors of conscience, men have little rest by night, for the grim thoughts of the day dog them to their chambers and haunt their dreams, or else they lie awake in a cold sweat of dread. God&#39;s hand is very helpful when it uplifts, but it is awful when it presses down: better a world on the shoulder, like Atlas, than God&#39;s hand on the heart, like David. &#39;&#39; <span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moisture </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>turned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>drought </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>summer.</span>&#39;&#39; The sap of his soul was dried, and the body through sympathy appeared to be bereft of its needful fluids. The oil was almost gone from the lamp of life, and the flame flickered as though it would soon expire. Unconfessed transgression, like a fierce poison, dried up the fountain of the man&#39;s strength and made him like a tree blasted by the lightning, or a plant withered by the scorching heat of a tropical sun. Alas ! for a poor soul when it has learned its sin but forgets its Saviour, it goes hard with it indeed. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Selah.&quot; </span>It was time to change the tune, for the notes are very low in the scale, and with such hard usage, the strings of the harp are out of order: the next verse will surely be set to another key, or will rehearse a more joyful subject.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA91.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.106.1.2.box.174.1150.1305.741.q.60'>5. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>acknowledged </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>After long lingering, the broken heart bethought itself of what it ought to have done at the first, and laid bare its bosom before the Lord. The lancet must be let into the gathering ulcer before relief can be afforded. The least thing we can do, if we would be pardoned, is to acknowledge our fault; if we are too proud for this we doubly deserve punishment. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hid.&quot; </span>We must confess the guilt as well as the fact of sin. It is useless to conceal it, for it is well known to God; it is beneficial to us to own it, for a full confession softens and humbles the heart. We must as far as possible unveil the secrets of the soul, dig up the hidden treasure of Achan, and by weight and measure bring out our sins. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>said.&quot; </span>This was his fixed resolution. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>confess </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>transgressions </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>Not to my fellow men or to the high priest, but unto Jehovah ; even in those days of symbol the faithful looked to God alone for deliverance from sin&#39;s intolerable load, much more now, when types and shadows have vanished at the appearance of the dawn. When the soul determines to lay low and plead guilty, absolution is near at hand; hence we read, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forgavest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin.&quot; </span>Not only was the sin itself pardoned, but the iniquity of it: the virus of its guilt was put away, and that at once, so soon as the acknowledgment was made. God&#39;s pardons are deep and thorough: the knife of mercy cuts at the roots of the ill weed of sin. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Selah.&quot; </span>Another pause is needed, for the matter is not such as may be hurried over.</p>

Remarkable answers to prayer very much quicken the prayerfulness of other godly persons. Where one man finds n golden nugget others feel inclined to dig. The benefit of our experience to others should reconcile us to it. No doubt the case of David has led thousands to seek the Lord with hopeful courage who, without such an instance to cheer them, might have died in despair. Peihups the psalmist meant <span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span>this favour or the like all godly souls would seek, and here, again, we can confirm his testimony, for all will draw near to God in the same manner as he did when godliness rules their heart. The mercy seat is the way to heaven for all who shall ever come there. There is, however, a set time for prayer, beyond which it will be unavailing ; between the time of sin and the day of punishment mercy rules the hour, and God may be found, but when once the sentence has gone forth pleading will be useless, for the Lord will not be found by the condemned soul. O dear reader, slight not the accepted time, waste not the day of salvation. The godly pray while the Lord has promised to answer, the ungodly postpone their petitions till the Master of the house has risen up and shut to the door, and then their knocking is too late. What a blessing to be led to seek the Lord before the great devouring floods leap forth from their lairs, for then when they do appear we shall be safe. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Surely </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>floods </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>great </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nigh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him.&quot; </span>The floods shall come, and the waves shall rage, and toss themselves like Atlantic billows; whirlpools and waterspouts shall be on every hand, but the praying man shall be at a safe distance, most surely secured from every ill. David was probably most familiar with those great land-floods which fill up, with rushing torrents, the beds of rivers which at other times are almost dry: these overflowing waters often did great damage, and, as in the case of the Kishon, were sufficient to sweep away whole armies. From sudden and overwhelming disasters thus set forth in metaphor the true suppliant will certainly be held secure. He who is saved from sin, has no need to fear anything else.</p>

Personal claims upon our God are the joy of spiritual life. To lay our hand upon the Lord with the clasp of a personal &quot; my&quot; is delight at its full. Observe that the same man who in the fourth verse was oppressed by the presence of God, here finds a shelter in him. See what honest confession and full forgiveness will do &#39;. The gospel of substitution makes him to be our refuge who otherwise would have been our judge. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preserve </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trouble.&quot; </span>Trouble shall do me no real harm when the Lord is with me, rather it shall bring me much benefit, like the file which clears away the rust, but does not destroy the metal. Observe the three tenses, we have noticed the sorrowful past, the last sentence was a joyful present, this is a cheerful future. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>compass </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>about </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>songs </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><i>deliverance.&quot; </i>What a golden sentence! The man is encircled in song, surrounded by dancing mercies, all of them proclaiming the triumphs of grace. There is no breach in the circle, it completely rings him round; on all sides he hears music. Before him hope sounds the cymbals, and behind him gratitude beats the timbrel. Right and left, above and beneath, the air resounds with joy, and all this for the very man who, a few weeks ago, was roaring all the day long. How great a change! What wonders grace has done and still can do !&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Selah.&quot; </span>There was need of a pause, for love so amazing needs to be pondered, and joy so great demands quiet contemplation, since language fails to express it.</p>

Our Saviour is our instructor. The Lord himself deigns to teach his children to walk in the way of integrity, his holy word and the monitions of the Holy Spirit are the directors of the believer&#39;s daily conversation. We are not pardoned that we may henceforth live after our own lusts, but that we may be educated in holiness and trained for perfection. A heavenly training is one of the covenant blessings which adoption seals to us: &quot;All thy children shall be taught by the Lord.&quot; Practical teaching is the very bestof instruction, and they are thrice happy who, although they never sat at the feet of Gamaliel, and are ignorant of Aristotle, and the ethics of the schools, have nevertheless learned to follow the Lamb withersoever he goeth. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Twill </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>guide </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eye.&quot; </span>As servants take their cue from the master&#39;s eye, and a nod or a wink is all that they require, so should we obey the slightest hints of our Master, not needing thunderbolts to startle our incorrigible sluggishness, but being controlled by whispers and love-touches. The Lord is the great overseer, whose eye in providence overlooks everything. It is well for us to be the sheep of his pasture, following the guidance of his wisdom.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.108.1.1.box.95.926.1299.628.q.60'>9. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>horse, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>or </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mule, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>understanding.&#39;&#39; </span>Understanding separates man from a brute&#8212;let us not act as if we were devoid of it. Men should take counsel and advice, and be ready to run where wisdom points them the way. Alas I we need to be cautioned against stupidity of heart, for we are very apt to fall into it. We who ought to be as the angels, readily become as the beasts. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mouth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>must </span><i>be </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>held </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bridle, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>near </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&quot; </span>It is much to be deplored that we so often need to be severely chastened before we will obey. We ought to be as a feather in the wind, wafted readily in the breath of the Holy Spirit, but alas! we lie like motionless logs, and stir not with heaven itself in view. Those cutting bits of affliction show how hard-mouthed we are, those bridles of infirmity manifest our headstrong and wilful manners. We should not be treated like mules if there was not so much of the ass about us. If we will be fractious, we must expect to be kept in with tight rein. Oh, for grace to obey the Lord willingly, lest like the wilful servant, we are beaten with many stripes. Calvin renders the last words, &quot;Lest they kick against thee,&quot; a version more probable and more natural, but the passage is confessedly obscure&#8212;not, however, in its general sense.</p>

We read of one who died at the foot of the scaffold of overjoy at the receipt of his monarch&#39;s pardon; and shall we receive the free pardon of the King of kings and yet pine in inexcusable sorrow ?&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>Here is the directory by which gladness is preserved from levity. We are not to be glad in sin, or to find comfort in corn, and wine, and oil, but in our God is to be the garden of our soul&#39;s delight. That there is a God. and such a God, and that he is ours, ours for ever, our Father and our reconciled Lord, is matter enough for a never-ending psalm of rapturous joy. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>re</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>joice, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteous,&quot; </span>redouble your rejoicing, peal upon peal. Since God has clothed his choristers in the white garments of holiness, let them not restrain their joyful voices, but sing aloud and shout as those who find great spoil. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shout </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>joy, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><i>are </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>upright </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&quot; </span>Our happiness should be demonstrative; chill penury of love often represses the noble flame of joy, and men whisper their praises decorously where a hearty outburst of song would be far more natural. It is to be feared that the church of the present day, through a craving for excessive propriety, is growing too artificial; so that enquirers&#39; cries and believers&#39; shouts would be silenced if they were heard in our assemblies. This may be better than boisterous fanaticism, but there is as much danger in the one direction as the other. For our part, we are touched to the heart by a little sacred excess, and when godly men in their joy o&#39;erleap the narrow bounds of decorum, we do not, like Michal, Saul&#39;s daughter, eye them with a sneering heart. Note how the pardoned are represented as upright, righteous, and without guile; a man may have many faults and yet be saved, but a false heart is everywhere the damning mark. A man of twisting, shifty ways, of a crooked, crafty nature, is not saved, and in nil probability never will be; for the ground which brings forth a harvest when grace is sown in it, may be weedy and waste, but our Lord tells us it is <span style='font-style:italic;'>honest </span>and good ground. Our observation has been that men of double tongues and tricky ways are the least likely of all men to be saved: certainly where grace comes, it restores man&#39;s mind to its perpendicular, and delivers him from being doubled up with vice, twisted with craft, or bent with dishonesty.</p>

This is a mark of a true penitent, when he hath been a stumbling block to others, to be as careful to raise them up by his repentance as he was hurtful to them by his sin ; and I never think that man truly penitent who is ashamed to teach sinners repentance, by his own particular proof. The Samaritan &quot;woman, when she was converted, left her bucket at the well, entered the city, and said, &quot;Come forth, yonder is a man who hath told me all that I have done.&quot; And our Saviour saith to M. Peter, &quot;When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.&quot; John iv. 29 ; Luke xxii. 32. St. Paul also after his conversion is not ashamed to call himself chiefest of all sinners, and to teach others to repent of their sins by repenting for his own.

The Hebrew word to <span style='font-style:italic;'>forgive, </span>signifies to carry out of sight; which well agrees with that Jer. !. 20, &quot;In those days, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found.&quot; This is an incomprehensible blessing, and such as lays a foundation for all other mercies. I shall but glance at it, and lay down these five assertions about it. 1. Forgiveness is an act of God&#39;s free grace. The Greek word <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forgive, </span>deciphers the original of pardon; it ariseth not from anything inherent in us, but is the pure result of free grace. Isa. xliii. 25. &quot;I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake.&quot; When a creditor forgives a debtor, he doeth it freely. Paul cries out, &quot;I obtained mercy.&quot; 1 Tim. i. 13. The Greek signifies, &quot;I was be-mercied;&quot; he who is pardoned, is all bestrewed with mercy. When the Lord pardons a sinner, he doth not pay a debt, but give a legacy. 2. God in forgiving sin, remits the guilt and penalty. Guilt cries for justice: no sooner had Adam eaten the apple, but he saw the flaming sword, and heard the curse; but in remission God doth indulge the sinner : he seems to say thus to him: Though thou art fallen into the hands of my justice, and deserves to die, yet I will absolve thee, and whatever is charged upon thee shall be discharged. 3. Forgiveness of sin is through the blood of Christ. Free grace is the impulsive cause; Christ&#39;s blood is the meritorious. &quot;Without shedding of blood is no remission.&quot; Heb. ix. 22. Justice would be revenged either on the sinner or the surety. Every pardon is the price of blood. 4. Before sin is forgiven, it must be repented of. Therefore repentance and remission are linked together. &quot;That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name.&quot; Luke xxiv. 47. Not that repentance doth in a Popish sense merit forgiveness ; Christ&#39;s blood must wash our tears; but repentance is a qualification, though not a cause. He who is humbled for sin will the more value pardoning mercy. 5. God having forgiven sin, he will call it no more into remembrance. Jer. xxxi. 34. The Lord will make an act of indemnity, he will not upbraid us with former unkindnesses, or sue us with the cancelled bond. &quot;He will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.&quot; Mic. vii. 19. Sin shall not be cast in as a cork which riseth up again, but as lead which sinks to the bottom.

And then, partly, too, with respect to those for whoso use this instruction was written, that they might not look upon it as a light and trivial thing, but be thoroughly apprehensive of the worth of so great a privilege. Blessed, happy, thrice happy they who have obtained pardon of their sins, and justification by Jesus Christ. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Manton. </span></p>

Not he who cloaks, conceals, confesses not his sin. As long as David was in this state he was miserable. There was guile in his spirit (2), misery in his heart, his very bones waxed old, his moisture was dried up as the drought in summer (3, 4). Who is blessed? He that is without sin, he who sins not, he who grieves no more by his sin the bosom on which he reclines. This is superlative blessedness, its highest element the happiness of heaven. To be like God, to yield implicit, ready, full, perfect obedience, the obedience of the heart, of our entire being: this is to be blessed above all blessedness.

How must sin have darkened and deadened his spiritual faculties, to have guile in the spirit of one who could elsewhere exclaim, &quot;Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts : and see if there be any wicked way in me,&quot; any way of pain or grief, any way of sin which most surely leads to these. (Ps. exxxix. 23, 34.) What a mournful condition of soul was his, who while he roared all the day long, yet kept silence before God, had no heart to open his heart unto God, was dumb before him, not in submission to his will, not in accepting the punishment of his iniquity (Lev. xxvi. 4G), not in real confession, and honest, upright, and sincere acknowledgment of his iniquity to him against whom he had committed it. <span style='font-style:italic;'>kept </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>silence&quot; </span>not merely I was silent, &quot;I <i>kept </i>silence,&quot; resolutely, perseveringly; I kept it notwithstanding all the remembrance of my past mercies, notwithstanding my reproaches of conscience, and my anguish of heart.

Wipe thine eyes again, poor soul, and then if thou readest such places, wherein the Spirit of God speaks so highly and hyperbolically of his saints&#39; grace, thou shalt find he doth not assert the perfection of their grace, free from all mixture of sin, but rather to comfort poor drooping souls, and cross their misgiving hearts, which, from the presence of hypocrisy, are ready to overlook their sincerity as none at all, he expresseth his high esteem of their little grace, by speaking of it as if it were perfect, and their hypocrisy none at all.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></span></p>

Who would not declare all his debts when they are certain to be discharged by another? Who would not declare his malady when he was sure of a cure? True faith knows not only that <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;guile&quot; </span>before God is impossible, but also that it is no longer necessary. The believer has nothing to conceal : he sees himself as before God, stripped, and laid open, and bare; and if he has learned to see himself as he is, so also has he learned to see God as he reveals himself. There is no guile in the spirit of one who is justified by faith; because in the act of justification truth has been established in his inward parts. There is no guile in the spirit of him who sees the truth of himself in the light of the truth of God. For the truth of God shows him at once that in Christ he is perfectly righteous before God, and in himself he is-the chief of sinners. Such a one knows he is not his own, for he is bought with a price, and therefore he is to glorify God. There is no guile in the spirit of him whose real object is to glorify Christ and not himself. But when a man is not quite true to Christ, and has not quite ceased to magnify self, there may be guile, for he will be more occupied with thoughts about himself than with the honour of Christ. But if the truth, and honour, and glory of Christ be his supreme care, he may leave himself out of the question, and, like Christ, &quot;O commit himself to him that judgeth righteously.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Eveve, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M.A., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Lectures </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thirty-second </span><i>Psalm,&quot; </i>1860.</p>

There are many queries to be dispatched in the handling of this point. The first query is, what are the reasons why persons justified and pardoned are yet bound to make confession of sin unto God in private? The reasons are six. First, they are to confess sin unto God because holy confession gives it great deal of ease and holy quiet unto the mind of a sinner: concealed and indulged guilt contracts horror and dread on the conscience. Secondly, because God loves to hear the complaints and the confessions of his own people. Lying on the face is the best gesture, and the mourning weed the best garment that God is well pleased with. A third reason is, because confession of sin doth help to quicken the heart to strong and earnest supplication to God (see verse 6). Confession is to the soul as the whetstone is to the knife, that sharpens it and puts an edge on it; so doth confession of sin. Confessing thy evils to God doth sharpen and put an edge on thy supplication; that man will pray but faintly that doth confess sin but slightly. A fourth reason is, because confession of sin will work a holy contrition and a godly sorrow in the heart. (Psalm xxxviii. 18.) Declaration doth work compunction. Confession of sin is but the causing of sin to recoil on the conscience, which causeth blushing and shame of face, and grief of heart. A fifth reason is, because secret confession of sin doth give a great deal of glory to God. It gives glory to God&#39;s justice. I do confess sin, and do confess God in</p>

It gives glory to God&#39;s omniscience. In confessing sin I do acknowledge that God knoweth my sin.

Now David, to make the pardoning mercy of God more illustrious, saith he did not only forgive his <i>sin, </i>but the <span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity </span>of his sin ; and what was that? Surely the worst that can be said of that, his complicated sin, is that there was so much hypocrisy ia it, he wofnlly juggled with God and man in it; this, I do not doubt to say, was <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity </span>of his sin, and put a colour deeper on it than the blood which he shed. And the rather&#8212;I lay the accent there&#8212;because God himself, when be would set out the heinousness of this sin, seems to do it rather from the hypocrisy in the fact than the fact itself, as appears by the testimony given this holy man (1 Kings xv. 5): &quot;David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.&quot; Were there not other false steps which David took beside this? Doth the Spirit of God, by excepting this, declare his approbation of all that else he ever did? No, sure the Spirit of God records other sins that escaped this eminent servant of the Lord; but all those are drowned here, and this mentioned is the only stain of his life. But why? Surely because there appeared less sincerity, yea, more hypocrisy in this one sin than in all his others put together; though David in them was wrong as to the matter of his actions, yet his heart was more right in the manner of committing them. But here his sincerity was sadly wounded, though not to the total destruction of the habit, yet to lay it in a long swoon, as to any actings thereof. And truly the wound went very deep when that grace was stabbed in which did run the life blood of all the rest. We see, then, God hath reason, though his mercy prompted him, yea, his covenant obliged him, not to let his child die of this wound, yet so to heal it that a scar might remain upon the place, a mark upon the sin, whereby others might know how odious hypocrisy is to God.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ournall. </span></p>

It is commonly supposed that after his grievous fall, till Nathan reproved him, he had been careless and stupefied; and this has often been addnced as a pr oof of the hardening nature of sin. But the thing was far otherwise. He was all the while tortured in his mind, yet unwilling to humble himself before God, and condemn himself before men, as he ought to have done. He kept silence, and endeavoured to pass off the distress by time, palliation, and excuse. But the repression and concealment of his anguish preyed not only upon his peace, but his health, and endangered life itself. At length he was reduced to the deepest penitence, and threw himself, by an unqualified confession, on the compassion of God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>every </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>one </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>godly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pray </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>Here we see not only that all the godly pray, but every one of them prays for pardon. This is the very thing which our Saviour teaches his disciples: &quot;When ye pray, say, Forgive us our trespasses.&quot; And this praying does not only regard the manifestation of forgiving mercy, as some would have it, but the exercise of it.&#8212; <i>William </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jay. </span></p>

For it may be said, Many holy men have lost their goods, have suffered great torments in their body, have been troubled also in mind; how then did not the &quot;floods of many waters&quot; come near them? The word <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;him&quot; </span>helps us to answer. The very philosophers themselves reckoned their goods pertained no more to them, than, be it spoken with reverence and regard, the parings of their nails. Zenon hearing news he had lost all he had by sea, said only thus, Thou hast done very well. Fortune, to leave me nothing but my cloak. Another, called Anaxarchus, when as Nicocreon the tyrant commanded he should be beaten to death in a mortar, spake thus to the executioner, Beat and bray as long as thou wilt Anaxarchus his bag or satchel (so he called his own body), but Anaxarchus thou canst not touch. Yet these, making so small reckoning of their goods and body, set their mind notwithstanding at a high rate. The mind of a man is himself, say they. Hence it is<a id='GBS.PA106.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.121.1.0.box.244.278.1286.567.q.50'>
that Julius Caesar, when Amyclas the pilot was greatly afraid of the tempest, spake to him thus: What meanest thou to fear, base fellow? dost thou not know thou earriest Coesar with thee? As if he should say, Caesar&#39;s body may well be drowned, as any other man&#39;s, may ; but his mind, his magnanimity, his valour, his fortitude, can never be drowned. Thus far went philosophy; but divinity goeth a degree further. For philosophy dtfineth <span style='font-style:italic;'>him, </span>that is, a man, by his reason, and the moral virtues of the mind ; but divinity defiuetli a Christian man by his faith, and his conjunction thereby with Christ. Excellently saith 8aint Austin: Whence comes it that the soul dieth? Because faith is not in it. Whence that the body dieth? Because a soul is not in it. Therefore the soul of thy soul is faith. So that if we would know what is a faithful man, we must define him, not by his natural soul, as he is reasonable, but by the soul of his soul, which is his faith. And then we easily answer the objection, that a flood may come near a faithful man&#39;s goods, near his body, near his reasonable soul; but to his faith, that is, to <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Him, </span>it can never come near.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Playfere. </span></span></p>

How different is an <span style='font-style:italic;'>appropriating </span>from a <span style='font-style:italic;'>sjiecu</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>latite </span>faith! Men tell us that they believe the doctriue, that they acknowledge the truth, that they assent to our creed; and they say, that to declare to them the character of Christ as the sinner&#39;s only help and safety, is merely putting before them what they already know. Now, follow up the idea suggested by the figure in our text, and see the folly and danger of acting thus. Suppose a traveller upon a bleak and exposed heath to be alarmed by the approach of a storm. He looks out for shelter. But if his eye discern a place to hide him from the storm, does he stand still and say, &quot;&#8226; I see there <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span>a shelter, and therefore I may remain where I am&quot;? Does he not betake himself to it? Does he not run, in order to escape the stormy wind and tempest? It was a &quot;hidingplace&quot; before; but it was <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>hiding-place only when he ran into it. and was safe. Had he not gone into it, though it might have been a protection to a thousand other travellers who resorted there, to him it would have been as if no such place existed. Who does not see at once, from this simple illustration, that the blessings of the gospel are such only in their being <span style='font-style:italic;'>appropriated </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span>the soul? The physician can cure only by being <span style='font-style:italic;'>applied </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>the medicine can heal only by being <span style='font-style:italic;'>taken; </span>money can enrich only by being <span style='font-style:italic;'>possessed</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>and the merchantman in the parable would have been none the wealthier for discovering that there was a &quot;pearl of great price,&quot; had he not madeitAi&#39;8. Bo with the salvation of the gospel: if Christ is the &quot;Balm in Gilead,&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>apply </span>the remedy; if he is the &quot; physician there,&quot; go to him ; if he is the &quot;pearl of great price,&quot; sell all that you have and <span style='font-style:italic;'>buy </span>it ; and if he is the &quot; hiding-place,&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>run </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span>it and be safe; there will be no solid joy and peace in the mind until he is <span style='font-style:italic;'>your </span>&quot;hiding-place.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Fountain </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Elwin, </span>1842.</p>

And so this first part is an instruction <span style='font-style:italic;'>de </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>credendis, </span>of such things, as by God&#39;s rectifying of our understanding we are bound to believe. And then, in a second part, there follows a more particular instructing, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Docebo, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>teach </span><i>thee,&quot; </i>and that <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>via, </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>way;&quot; </span>it is not only <span style='font-style:italic;'>de </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vin, </span>to teach thee which is the way, that thou mayst find it, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>via, </span>how to keep the way when thou art in it; he will teach thee, not only <span style='font-style:italic;'>ut </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gradiaris, </span>that thou mayst walk in it and not sleep, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>quomodo </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gradieris, </span>that thou mayst walk in it and not stray ; and so this second part is an institution <span style='font-style:italic;'>de </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>agendis, </span>of those things which, thine understanding being formerly rectified, and deduced into a belief, thou art bound to do. And then in the last words of the text, &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>guide </span><i>thee </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eye,&quot; </span>there is a third part, an establishment, a confirmation by an incessant watchfulness in God ; he will consider, consult upon us (for so much the original word imports), he will not leave us to contingencies, to fortune ; no, nor to his own general providence, by which all creatures are universally in his protection and administration, but he will ponder us, consider us, study us ; and that with his eye, which is the sharpest and most sensible organ and instrument, soonest feels if anything be amiss, and so inclines him quickly to rectify us ; and so this third part is an instruction <span style='font-style:italic;'>de </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sperandis, </span>it hath evermore a relation to the future, to the constancy and perseverance of God&#39;s goodness towards us ; to the end, and in the end he will guide us with his eye: except the eye of God can be put out we cannot be put out of his sight and his care. So that, both our freight which we are to take in, that is, what we are to believe concerning God; and the voyage which we are to make, how we are to steer and govern our course, that is, our behaviour and conversation in the household of the faithful; and then the haven to which we must go, that is, our assurance of arriving at the heavenly Jerusalem, are expressed in this chart, in this map, in this instruction, in this text.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Donne. </span></p>

His word infuses good purposes into us; but if God continue his eye upon us, it is a further approbation, for he is a God of pure eyes, and will not look upon the wicked. &quot;This land doth the Lord thy God care for, and the eyes of the Lord are always upon it from the beginning of the year, even to the end thereof.&quot; Deut. xi. 12. What a cheerful spring, what a fruitful autumn hath that soul, that hath the eye of the Lord always upon her! The eye of the Lord upon me makes midnight noon; it makes Capricorn Cancer, and the winter&#39;s the summer&#39;s solstice; the eye of the Lord sanctifies, nay, more than sanctifies, glorifies all the eclipses of dishonour, makes melancholy cheerfulness, diffidence assurance, and turns the jealousy of the sad soul into infallibility. . . . This guiding us with his eye manifests itself in these two great effects; conversion to him, and union with him. First, his eye works upon ours; his eye turns ours to look upon him. Still it is so expressed with an <span style='font-style:italic;'>Ecce</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>&quot;Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon all them that fear him;&quot; his eye calls ours to behold that; and then our eye calls upon his, to observe our cheerful readiness. . . . When, as it well made picture doth always look upon him that looks upon it, this image of God in our soul is turned to him, by his turning to it, it is impossible we should do any foul, any uncomely thing in his presence. . . . The other great effect of his guiding us with his eye, is, that it unites us to himself; when he fixes his eye upon us, and accepts the return of ours to him, then he &quot;keeps&quot; us as the &quot;apple&quot; of his &quot;eye.&quot; Zech. ii. 8. .... These are the two great effects of his guiding us by his eye, that first, his eye turns us to himself, and then turns us into himself; first, his eye turns ours to him, and then, that makes us all one with himself, so as that our afflictions shall be put upon his patience, and our dishonours shall be injurious to him; we cannot be safer than by being his ; but thus we are not only his, but he; to every persecutor, in every one of our behalf, he shall say, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Cur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me? </span>Why persecutest thou me?

They consider the horse and the mule to admit any rider, any burden, without discretion or difference, without debatement or consideration; they never ask whether their rider be noble or base, nor whether their load be gold for the treasure, or roots for the market. And those expositors find the same indifference in an habitual sinner to any kind of sin; whether he sin for pleasure, or sin for profit, or sin but for company, still he sins. They consider in the mule, that one of his parents being more ignoble than the other, he is likest the worst, he hath more of the ass than of the horse in him; and they find in us, that all our actions and thoughts taste more of the ignobler part of earth than of heaven. St. Hierome thinks fierceness and rashness to be presented in the horse, and sloth in the mule. And St. Augustine carries these two qualities far; he thinks that in this fierceness of the horse the Gentiles are represented, which ran far from the knowledge of Christianity ; and by the laziness of the mule the Jews, who came nothing so fast, as they were invited by their former helps to the embracing thereof. They have gone far in these allusions and applications; and they might have gone as far further as it had pleased them; they have sea-room enough, that will compare a beast and a sinner together; and they shall find many times, in the way, the beast the better man.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><i>Donne. </i></p>

The verb is a military term, and signifies to advance, as an enemy, to attack. The &quot;coming near,&quot; therefore, intended here, is a coming near to do mischief. The admonition given by the psalmist to his companions, is to submit to the instruction and guidance graciously promised from heaven, and not to resemble, in a refractory disposition, those ill-conditioned colts which are not to be governed by a simple bridle; but, unless their jaws are confined by a muzzle, will attack the rider as he attempts to mount, or the groom as he leads them to the pasture and the stable.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Horsley. </span></span></p>

Wherein we have two things necessary to be observed. First the dulness of our natures, who as slow horses need many spurs and provocations to spiritual things, whereas we are naturally overmuch bent to carnal things, that we need no incitations thereunto. But by the contrary in spiritual things, we are cast into a deep sleep, who cannot be awakened at the first cry; but as men after drink have need to be roused often, that they may behold the light; so men drunken with the pleasures of sin, as Nazianzen saith, must be wakened by divers exhortations; as this same prophet in the subsequent Psalm redoubleth his exhortations for the same effect. And the apostle to the Philippians saith: &quot;Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, rejoice,&quot; (chap. iv. 4.) Next, perceive that this exhortation<a id='GBS.PA112.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.127.1.0.box.262.279.1296.389.q.60'>
grows: for the word <span style='font-style:italic;'>beglad, </span>properly in the original signifieth an inward and hearty joy, by the presence or hope at least of a thing desirable or good. The word <span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoice, </span>to express our joy by some outward gesture, sometimes used for dancing, as, &quot;The hills skip for gladness.&quot; Ps. <span style='font-style:italic;'>\xv. </span>12. The word <i>be </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>joyful, </span>to cry for gladness, as the dumb man&#39;s tongue shall sing. This gradation teacheth us, that this is the nature of spiritual joy&#8212;that it still increaseth in us by certain degrees, until it come to the prefection of all joy, which is signified by the last word, importing, as it were, a triumph and shouting after victory. So that they are truly penitent who have overcome sin and Satan in their spiritual combat, and have triumphed over them as vanquished enemies.&#8212; <i>Archibald </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>Symson. </span></span></p>

If in the beginning of a Psalm we find him restless in his motions, like Noah&#39;s dove upon the overspreading waters; yet in the close we shall see him like the same dove returning with an olive branch in its mouth, and fixing upon the ark. If we find him in another Psalm staggering in the midst of his distresses, through the prevalency of carnal fears, we may also in it behold him recovering himself again, by fetching arguments from faith, whose topies are of a higher elevation than to be shaken by the timorous suggestions that arise from the flesh. If at another time we behold him like to a boat on drift, that is, tossed and beaten by the inconstant winds and fierce waves; yet we shall still find all his rollings and agitations to be such as carry him towards the standing shore, where he rides at last both in peace and safety.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Spurstowe. </span></p>

To delight ourselves in God is most truly to extol him, even if we let no notes of song proceed from our lips. That God is, and that he is such a God, and our God, ours for ever and ever, should wake within us an unceasing and overflowing joy. To rejoice in temporal comforts is dangerous, to rejoic^in self is foolish, to rejoice in sin is fatal, but to rejoice in God is heavenly. CHe who would have a double heaven must begin below to rejoice like those aboyei &quot;O <span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><i>righteous.&quot; </i>This is peculiarly your duty, your obligations are greTrfer, and your spiritual nature more adapted to the work, be ye then first in the glad service.

When saints wear their choral robes, they look fair in the Lord&#39;s sight. A harp suits a bloodwashed hand. No jewel more ornamental to a holy face than sacred praise. ffraise is not comely from unpardoned professional singers; it is like a jewel of gold in a swine&#39;s snout. Crooked hearts make crooked music, but the upright are the Lord&#39;s delight. ^ Praise is the dress of saints in heaven, it is meet that they should fit it on below\</p>

This is the lesson to be gathered from the use of musical instruments under the old dispensation. Israel was at school, and used childish things to help her to learn; but in these days, when Jesus gives us spiritual manhood, we can make melody without strings and pipes. We who do not believe these things to be expedient in worship, lest they should mar its simplicity, do not affirm them to be unlawful, and if any George Herbert or Martin Luther can worship God better by the aid of well-tuned instruments, who shall gainsay their right? <span style='font-style:italic;'>We </span>do not need them, they would hinder than help our praise, but if others are otherwise minded, are they not living in gospel liberty? &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Sing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him.&quot; </span>This is the sweetest and best of music.

Do most worshippers mind this ? Our faculties should be exercised when we are magnifying the Lord, so as not to run in an old groove without thought; we ought to make every hymn of praise a new song. To keep up the freshness of worship is a great thing, aud in private it is indispensable. Let us not present old worn-out praise, but put life, and soul, and heart, into every song, since we have new mercies every day, and see new beauties in the work and word of our Lord. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Play </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>skilfully.&#39;&quot; </span>It is wretched to hear God praised in a slovenly manner. He deserves the best that we have. Every Christian should endeavour to sing according to the rules of the art, so that he may keep time and tune with the congregation. The sweetest tunes and the sweetest voices, with the sweetest words, are all too little for the Lord our God ; let us not offer him limping rhymes, sefc^to harsh tunes, and growled out by discordant voices. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>With </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>loud </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>noise.&#39;&#39; </span>Q^eartinesa should be conspicuous in divine worship^ Well-bred whispers are disreputable here. It is not that the Lord cannoPrrcar us, but that it is natural for great exultation to express itself in the loudest manner. Men shout at the sight of their kings: shall we offer no loud hosannahs to the Son of David?</p>

Whatever God has ordained must be good, and just, and excellent. There are no anomalies in God&#39;s universe, except what sin has made ; his word of command made all things good. When we look at his word of promise, and remember its faithfulness, what reasons have we for joy and thankfulness !&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>done </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth.&quot; </span>His work is the outflow of his word, and it is true to it. He neither doth nor saith anything ill; in deed and speech he agrees with himself and the purest truth. There is no lie in God&#39;s word, and no sham in his works; in creation, providence, and revelation, unalloyed truth abounds. To act truth as well as to utter it is divine. Let not children of God ever yield their principles in practice any more than in heart. What a God we serve! The more we know of him, the more our better natures approve his surpassing excellence; even his afflicting works are according to his truthful word.</p>

Sin, on the other hand, is infinitely abhorrent to the Lord, and woe unto those who die in it ; if he sees no righteousness in them, he will deal righteously with them, and judgment stern and final will be the result. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>full </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>goodness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>Come hither, astronomers, geologists, naturalists, botanists, chemists, miners, yea, all of you who study the works of God, for all your truthful stories confirm this declaration.
