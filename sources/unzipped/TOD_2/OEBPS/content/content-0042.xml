While his heart was musing it was fusing, for the subject was confusing. It became harder every moment to be quiet; his volcanic soul was tossed with an inward ocean of fire, and heaved to and fro with a mental earthquake; an eruption was imminent, the burning lava must pour forth in a fiery stream, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Then </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>spake </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tongue.&#39;&#39; </span>The original is grandly laconic. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>spake.&quot; </span>The muzzled tongue burst all its bonds. The gag was hurled away. Misery, like murder, will out. You can silence praise, but anguish is clamorous. Resolve or no resolve, heed or no heed, sin or no sin, the impetuous torrent forced for itself a channel and swept away every restraint.</p>

Oh ! if my swelling heart must speak, Lord let it speak with thee; even if there be too much of natural heat in what I say, thou wilt be more patient with me than man, and upon thy purity it can cast no stain; whereas if I speak to my fellows, they may harshly rebuke me or else learn evil from my petulance. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Make </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>end.&quot; </span>Did he mean the same asElias in his agony, &quot; Let me die, I am no better than my father&quot;? Perhaps so. At any rate, he rashly and petulantly desired to know the end of his wretched life, that he might begin to reckon the days till death should put a finis to his woe. Impatience would pry between the folded leaves. As if there were no other comfort to be had, unbelief would fain hide itself in the grave and sleep itself into oblivion. David was neither the first nor the last who have spoken unadvisedly in prayer. Yet, there is a better meaning: the psalmist would know more of the shortness of life, that he might better bear its transient ills, and herein we may safely kneel with him, uttering the same petition. That there is no end to its misery is the hell of hell; that there is an end to life&#39;s sorrow is the hope of all who have a hope beyond the grave. God is the best teacher of the divine philosophy which looks for an expected end. They who see death through the Lord&#39;s glass, see a fair sight, which makes them forget the evil of life in foreseeing the end of life. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>measure </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>days.&quot; </span>David would fain be assured that his days would be soon over and his trials with them; he would be taught anew that life is measured out to us by wisdom, and is not a matter of chance. As the trader measures his cloth by inches, and ells, and yards, so with scrupulous accuracy is life measured out toman. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>how </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>frail </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am,&quot; </span>or when I shall cease to be. Alas! poor human nature, dear as life is, man quarrels with God at such a rate that he would sooner cease to be than bear the Lord&#39;s appointment. Such pettishness in a saint! Let us wait till we are in a like position, and we shall do no better. The ship on the stocks wonders that the barque springs a leak, but when it has tried the high seas, it marvels that its timbers hold together in such storms. David&#39;s case is not recorded for our imitation, but for our learning.</p>

What changeful creatures we are! One moment we cry to be rid of existence, and the next instant beg to have it prolonged! A handbreadth is one of the shortest natural measures, being the breadth of four fingers; such is the brevity of life, by divine appointment; God hath made it so, fixing the period in wisdom. The &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>behold</span>&quot; calls us to attention; to some the thoughts of life&#39;s hastiness will bring the acutest pain, to others the most solemn earnestness. How well should those live who are to live so little! Is my earthly pilgrimags so brief? then let me watch every step of it, that in the little of time there may be much of grace. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>age </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nothing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>So short as not to amount to an entity.

His vanity is his only verity; his best, of which he is vain, is but vain; and this is verily true of every man, that everything about him is every way fleeting. This is sad news for those whose treasures are beneath the moon ; those whose glorying is in themselves may well hang the flag half-mast; but those whose best estate is settled upon them in Christ Jesus in, the land of unfading flowers, may rejoice that it is no vain thing in which they trust.</p>

This alone is sure, that nothing is sure. All around us shadows mock us; we walk among them, and too many live for them as if the mocking images were substantial ; acting their borrowed parts with zeal fit only to be spent on realities, and lost upon the phantoms of this passing scene. Worldly men walk like travelleis in 8 mirage, deluded, duped, deceived, soon to be filled with disappointment and despair. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Surely </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>disquieted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vain.&quot; </span>Men fret, and fume, and worry, and all for mere nothing. They are shadows pursuing shadows, while death pursues them. He who toils and contrives, and wearies himself for gold, for fame, for rank, even if he wins his desire, finds at the end his labour lost; for like the treasure of the miser&#39;s dream, it all vanishes when the man awakes in the world of reality. Read well this text, and then listen to the clamour of the market, the hum of the exchange, the din of the city streets, and remember that all this <span style='font-style:italic;'>noise </span>(for so the word means), this breach of quiet, is made about unsubstantial, fleeting vanities. Broken rest, anxious fear, over-worked brain, failing mind, lunacy, these are steps in the process of disquieting with many, and all to be rich, or, in other words, to load one&#39;s self with the thick clay ; clay, too, which B man must leave so soon. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heapcth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>riches, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hioiceth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nut </span><i>who </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>thall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gather </span><i>them.&quot; </i>He misses often the result of his ventures, for there are many slips between the cup and the lips. His wheat is sheaved, but: loping robber bears it away&#8212;as often happens with the poor Eastern husbi man ; or, the wheat is even stored, but the invader feasts thereon. Many&#39; others all unknown to them. Especially does this verse refer to those all-gathe muckrakes, who in due time are succeeded by all-scattering forks, which scatter riches as profusely as their sires gathered them parsimoniously. We know not our heirs, for our children die, and strangers fill the old ancestral halls; estates change hands, and entail, though riveted with a thousand bonds, yields to the corroding power of time. Men rise up early aud sit up late to build a house, and then the stranger tramps along its passages, laughs in its chambers, and forgetful of its first builder, calls it all his own. Here is one of the evils under the sun for which no remedy can be prescribed.</p>

It were worse than vanity to linger in the abodes of sorrow to gain a heritage of emptiness. The psalmist, therefore, turns to his God, in disgust of all things else; he has thought on the world and all things in it, and is relieved by knowing that such vain things are all passing away; he has cut all cords which bound him to earth, and is ready to sound &quot;Boot and saddle, up and away.&quot; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><i>shoe </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>The Lord is self-existent and true, and therefore worthy of the confidence of men; he will live when all the creatures die, and his fulness will abide when all second causes are exhausted; to him, therefore, let us direct our expectation, and on him let us rest our confidence. Away from sand to rock let all wise builders turn themselves, for if not to-day, yet surely ere long, a storm will rise before which nothing will be able to stand but that which has the lasting element of faith in God to cement it. David had but one hope, and that hope entered within the veil, hence he brought his vessel to safe anchorage, and after a little drifting all was peace.</p>

What is sorrow when compared with sin! Let but the poison of sin be gone from the cup, and we need not fear its gall, for the bitter will act meditinally. None can deliver a man from his transgression but the blessed One who is called Jesus, because he saves his people from their sins; and when he once wotks this great deliverance for a man from the cause, the consequences are sure to disappear too. The thorough cleansing desired is well worthy of note: to be saved from some transgressions would be of small benefit ; total and perfect deliverance is needed. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Make </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reproach </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>foolish.&quot; </span>The wicked are the foolish here meant : such are always on the watch for the faults of saints, and at once make them the theme of ridicule.

Nature failed to muzzle the mouth, but grace achieved the work in the worthiest manner. How like in appearance may two very different things appear! silence is ever silence, but it may be sinful in one case and saintly in another. What a reason for hushing every murmuring thought is the reflection, &quot;because thou didst it&quot;! It is his right to do as he wills, and he always wills to do that which is wisest and kindest; why should I then arraign his dealings? Nay, if it be indeed the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</p>

In all probability the Lord would grant the psaimist&#39;s petition, for he usually removes affliction when we are resigned to it; if we kiss the rod, our Father always burns it. When we are still, the rod is soon still. It is quite consistent with resignation to pray for the removal of a trial. David was fully acquiescent in the divine will, and yet found it in his heart to pray for deliverance; indeed, it was while he was rebellious that he was prayerless about his trial, and only when he became submissive did he plead for mercy. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consumed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand.<sup>,,</sup> </span>Good pleas may be found in our weakness and distress.

All our desires and delights are wretched moth-eaten things when the Lord visits us in his anger. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Surely </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>every </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><i>vanity.&quot; </i>He is as Trapp wittily says &quot; a curious picture of nothing.&quot; He is unsubstantial as his own breath, a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and then vnnisheth away. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Se.lah. </span>Well may this truth bring us to a pause, like the dead body of Amasa, which, lying in the way, stopped the hosts of Joab.</span></p>

Who can withstand tears, which are the irresistible weapons of weakness? How often women, children, beggars, and sinners, have betaken themselves to tears as their last resort, and therewith have won the desire of their hearts !&#8212;&quot; This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,&quot; falls not in vain. Tears speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues ; they act as keys upon the wards of tender hearts, and mercy denies them nothing, if through them the weeper looks to richer drops, even to the blood of Jesus. When our sorrows pull up the sluices of our eyes, God will ere long interpose and turn our mourning into joy. Long may he be quiet as though he regarded not, but the hour of deliverance will come, and come like the morning when the dewdrops are plentiful. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stranger </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>Not <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span>thee, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span>thee. Like thee, my Lord, a stranger among the sons of men, an alien from my mother&#39;s children. God made the world, sustains it, and owns it, and yet men treat him as though he were a foreign intruder; and as they treat the Master, so do they deal with the servants. &quot;&#39;Tis no surprising thing that we should be unknown.&quot; These words may also mean, &quot;I share the hospitality of God,&quot; like a stranger entertained by a generous host. Israel was bidden to deal tenderly with the stranger, and the God of Israel has in much compassion treated us poor aliens with unbounded liberality. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sojourner, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fathers </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;were.&quot; </span>They knew that this was not their rest; they passed through life in pilgrim guise, they used the world as travellers use an inn, and even so do I. Why should we dream of rest on earth when our fathers&#39; sepulchres are before our eyes? if they had been immortal, their sons would have had an abiding city this side the tomb; but as the sires were mortal, so must their offspring pass away. All of our lineage, without exception, were passing pilgrims, and such are we. David uses the fleeting nature of our life as an argument for the Lord&#39;s mercy, and it is such a one as God will regard. We show pity to poor pilgrims, and so will the Lord.</p>

It is one of the most excellent and distinguishing faculties of a reasonable creature; much beyond vocal speech, for in that, some birds may imitate us; but neither bird nor beast has anything of this kind of language, of reflecting or discoursing with itself. It is a wonderful brutality in the greatest part of men, who are so little conversant in this kind of speech, being framed and disposed for it, and which is not only of itself excellent, but of continual use and advantage; but it is a common evil among men to go abroad, and out of themselves, which is a madness, and a true distraction. It is true, a man hath need of a well set mind, when he speaks to himself; for otherwise, he may be worse company to himself than if he were with others. But he ought to endeavour to have a better with him, to call in God to his heart to dwell with him. If thus vrc did, we should find how sweet this were to speak to ourselves, by now and then intermixing our speech with discourses unto God. For want of this, the most part not only lose their time in vanity, in their converse abroad with others, but do carry in heaps of that vanity to the stock which is in their own hearts, and do converse with that in secret, which is the greatest and deepest folly in the world.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><i>Leighton. </i></p>

To the Christian, however, they are wholesome in many ways. They remind him of his guilt, they try his meekness and patience, they show him what he needs to guard against, and at last they redound to his honour and glory in the sight of him lor whose sake they were endured. In respect of the pills of slander, however, as well as the others, it is advisable not to roll them about continually in our minds, or judge of them according to the flesh, and the world&#39;s opinion. This will only increase their bitterness, spread the savour of it to the tongue, and fill the heart with proportional enmity.

Oh, how burning and flaming may we often observe the spirit of the holy psalmist David, in his acting of meditation! Musing made him hot, yea, burning hot at the heart. Thus oft in the beginning of a Psalm we find his heart low and discouraged, but as this musing was acted and heightened, his spirit grew hotter, and at last flies all on a flame, flies up to a very high pitch of heavenly heat. Oh, how do all the conscientious practisers of meditation, ever and anon experience these happy, heavenly heats, and heartenlargements! Ah, if all the saints&#39; so glorious heart-quickenings were gathered together, what a rich chain of pearls, pearls of rare experiences, would they make up of the heart-warming efficacies of meditation !&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Nathanael </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hanew. </span></p>

Now meditation is a help to prayer. Gersom calls it the nurse of prayer. Meditation is like oil to the lamp; the lamp of prayer will soon go out unless meditation cherish and support it. Meditation and prayer are like two turtles, if you separate one the other dies ; a cunning angler observes the time and season when the fish bite best, and then he throws in the angle, when the heart is warmed by meditation, now is the best season to throw in the angle of prayer, and fish for mercy. After Isaac had been in the field meditating he was fit for prayer when he came home. When the gun is full of powder it is fittest to discharge. So when the mind is full of good thoughts, a Christian is fittest by prayer to discharge; now he sends up whole volleys of sighs and groans to heaven. Meditation hath a double benefit in it, it pours in and pours out ; first it pours good thoughts into the mind, and then it pours out those thoughts again into prayer; meditation first furnisheth with matter to pray and then it furnisheth with a heart to pray. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vmsing,&quot; </span>saith David, and the very next words are a prayer, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>make </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>know </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>end.&quot; </span>I muse on the works of thy hands, I stretch forth my hands to thee.

Which though at the first bare view, it doth not always so appear, there being other texts of Holy Writ more excellent (if it were meet to make any comparison) where Selah is not found, yet if we dive into the <span style='font-style:italic;'>occasion, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>scope, </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>nature </span>of the sentence, we shall more willingly accept, when we consider, that it is an usual custom of the Holy Spirit, for our singular instruction and benefit, to propound things of a low and inferior nature to our deepest meditation. Instance Psalm ix. 16. &quot;The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth ; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands,&quot; which is shut up with &quot; Higgaion Selah,&quot; meditation Selah, as if he had said, here is a matter worthy of observation and eternal meditation ; the righteous should never forget this, that the wicked perish in their own counsels, and are taken in their own net. An observation worthy to be engraven in every religious person&#39;s bosom, that God will one time or other be known among the wicked by his most severe judgments executed upon them, though they would never learn by his patience and mercies ,to acknowledge him for their Lord. Thus far of the matter. Now it remains for a conclusion to unfold the several instructions which &quot;Selah&quot; afforded unto the congregation, which are these six.</p>

The discipline of the school may be harsh and stern; but that of the family is love. We are sure of this; and the consolation which it affords is unutterable. Love will not wrong us. There will be no needless suffering. Were this but kept in mind there would be fewer hard thoughts of God amongst men, even when his strokes are most severe.

All men indeed are strangers and sojourners, but the saints do best discern it, and most freely acknowledge it. Wicked men have no firm dwelling upon earth, but that is against their intentions; their inward thought and desire is that they may abide for ever; they are strangers against their wills, their abode is uncertain in the world, and they cannot help it. And pray mark, there are two distinct words used in this case, <span style='font-style:italic;'>strangers </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>sojourners. </span>. A stranger is one that hath his abode in a foreign country, that is not a native and a denizen of the place, though he liveth there, and in opposition to the natives, he is called the stranger: as if a Frenchman should live in England, he is a stranger. But a <span style='font-style:italic;'>sojourner </span>is one that intendeth not to settle, but only pssseth through a place, and is in motion travelling homeward. So the children of God in relation to a country of their own in another place, namely, heaven, they are denizens there, but strangers in the world; and they are sojourners and pilgrims in regard of their motion and journey towards their country. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Manton. </span></p>

A stranger in a foreign country is not known, nor valued according to his birth and breeding: so the saints walk up and down in the world like princes in disguise. 3.

A stranger is wary, that he may not five offence, and incur the hatred and displeasure of the natives. 6. A stranger is thankful for the least favour; so we must be thankfully contented with the things God hath bestowed upon us: anything in <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span>strange country is much. T. A stranger, that hath a journey to go, would puss over it as soon as he can, and so we, who have a journey to heaven desire to be dissolved. 8. A stranger buyeth not such things as he cannot carry with him ; he doth not buy trees, house, household stuff, but jewels and pearls, and such things ns are portable. Our great care should be to get the jewels of the covenant, the graces of God&#39;s Spirit, those things that will abide with us. 9. A stranger&#39;s heart is in his country; so is a saint&#39;s. 10. A stranger is inquisitive after the way, feapng lest he should go amiss, so is a Christian. 11. A stranger provides for his return, as a merchant, that he may return richly laden.

The most obvious and aggravated case is that in which the attachment has its foundations in the opportunities which life affords, of procuring &quot; the wages of unrighteousness,&quot; and &quot; the pleasures of bin.&quot; II. Life may inspire an <span style='font-style:italic;'>innocent </span>attachment, awakening our sympathy. . . . Life is a scene in which we often descry a verdant and luxuriant spot, teeming with health, and ease, and harmony, and joy. We have beheld the husbands and the wives whose interwoven regards have, from year to year, alleviated all their afflictions, and heightened all their privileges. We have beheld the parents and the children whose fellowship has yielded them, through the shifting seasons, a daily feast. There are indulgent masters, and faithful servants; some neighbourhoods are undisturbed; some Christian societies are exquisitely attractive; here and there we have intercourse with those individuals in whom are seen the beauties of high character irradiated by the beams of general prosperity. You would pronounce no censure on a man thus happily connected, were he, when beginning to languish, as one &quot; going the way of all the earth, to cry,&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;0 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>spare </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>recover </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>go </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hence, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>more.&#39;&#39; </span>III.

The language before us admits of being illustrated as the prayer of a <span style='font-style:italic;'>penitent, </span>a <span style='font-style:italic;'>saint, </span>and a <span style='font-style:italic;'>philanthropist. </span>1. Commend him who pleads for life as a <span style='font-style:italic;'>penitent. </span>Was it recently that the Holy Spirit first wounded him with the arrows of conviction? Perhaps, he doubts the source, the quality, and the result, of his powerful feelings. He knows that we may be solemnly impressed, without being converted. There are many considerations which entitle to favourable opinion those who, not having arrived at a view of their moral state, at once evident and encouraging, wish earnestly to live, till grace shall have carried them from victory to victory, and enabled them &quot; to make&quot; their &quot;calling and election sure.&#39;&#39; Even they may fall from their steadfastness; and these words, &quot;O spare me, that I may recover my strength,&quot; may proceed from the lips of B backslider, once more blushing, trembling, and petitioning to be restored. 2. Commend him, in the next place, who pleads for life, as a <i>saint. </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>. </span>The distinguished office of pleading, acting, and suffering, for the advancement of the divine honour among the profane, the sensual, the formal, and the worldly is delegated, exclusively, to &quot;the saints which are upon the earth.&quot; Yet, surely he whose attachment to life is strongly enhanced by a commission which dooms him to the contradiction of sinners, and defers &quot;the fulness of joy,&quot; a saint so magnanimous and devoted, puts forth the expressions of a piety which the very angels are compelled to revere. 8. Commend him, finally, who pleads for life as a <span style='font-style:italic;'>philanthropist. </span>I refer to the generous <span style='font-style:italic;'>patron, </span>a man intent on doing good. I would also refer to a fond <span style='font-style:italic;'>parent. </span>I would now refer to &quot;a <i>preacher </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteousness,&#39;&#39; </span>&quot;a good minister of Jesus Christ.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Outline </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>/Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>entitled </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Attachment </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Life,&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hughes, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M.A., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Funeral </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Met. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Owen, </span><i>H. </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>A., </span>1822.</span></p>

Impatience never lingered in his heart, much less escaped his lips. All through his agony in the garden, his trial of cruel mockings before Herod and Pilate, and his passion on the tree, he waited in omnipotence of patience. No glance of wrath, no word of murmuring, no deed of vengeance came from God&#39;s patient Lamb; he waited and waited on ; was patient, and patient to perfection, far excelling all others who have according to their measure glorified God in the fires. Job on the dunghill does not equal Jesus on the cross. The Christ of God wears the imperial crown among the patient.

Mark the figure of inclining, as though the suppliant cried out of the lowest depression, and condescending love stooped to hear his feeble moans. What a marvel is it that our Lord Jesus should have to cry as we do, and wait as we do, and should receive the Father&#39;s help after the same process of faith and pleading as must be gone through by ourselves! The Saviour&#39;s prayers among the midnight mountains and in Gethsemane expound this verse. The Son of David was brought very low, but he rose to victory; and here he teaches us how to conduct our conflicts so as to succeed after the same glorious pattern of triumph. Let us arm ourselves with the same mind ; and panoplied in patience, armed with prayer, and girt with faith, let us maintain the Holy War.</p>

his own person the terrible curse which was due to sin, he was so cast down as to be like a prisoner in a deep, dark, fearful dungeon, amid whose horrible glooms the captive heard a noise as of rushing torrents, while overhead resounded the tramp of furious foes. Our Lord in his anguish was like a captive in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>oubliettes, </span>forgotten of all mankind, immured amid honor, darkness, and desolation. Yet the Lord Jehovah made him to ascend from all his abasement; he retraced his steps from that deep hell of anguish into which he had been cast as our substitute. He who thus delivered our surety <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>extremis, </span>will not fail to liberate us from our far lighter griefs. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>miry </span>c/ny.&quot; The sufferer was as one who cannot find a foothold, but slips and sinks. The figure indicates not only positive misery as in the former figure, but the absence of solid comfort by which sorrow might have been rendered supportable. Once give man a good foothold, and a burden is greatly lightened, but to be loaded and to be placed on slimy, slippery clay, is to be tried doubly. Reader, with humble gratitude, adore the dear Redeemer who, for thy sake, was deprived of all consolation while surrounded with every form of misery; remark his gratitude at being upborne amid his arduous labours and sufferings, and if thou too hast experienced the divine help, be sure to join thy Lord in this song. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>set </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fvet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rock, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>established </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>goings.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>The Redeemer&#39;s work is done. He reposes on the firm ground of his accomplished engagements; he can never suffer again; for ever does he reign in glory.&quot; What a comfort to know that Jesus our Lord and Saviour stands on a sure foundation in all that he is and does for us, and his goings forth in love are not liable to be cut short by failure in years to come, for God has fixed him firmly. He is for ever and eternally able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing that in the highest heavens he ever liveth to make intercession for them. Jesus is the true Joseph taken from the pit to be Lord of all. It is something more than a &quot;sip of sweetness&quot; to remember that if we are cast like our Lord into the lowest pit of shame and sorrow, we shall by faith rise to stand on the same elevated, sure, and everlasting rock of divine favour and faithfulness.</span></p>

What a song is that in which his glad heart for ever leads the chorus of the elect! Not Miriam&#39;s tabour nor Moses&#39; triumphant hymn o&#39;er Miriam&#39;s chivalry can for a moment rival that ever new and exulting song. Justice magnified and grace victorious; hell subdued and heaven glorified ; death destioyed and immortality established ; sin o&#39;erthrown and righteousness resplendent; what a theme for a hymn in that day when our Lord drinketh the red wine new with us all in our heavenly Father&#39;s kindgom!

Here is our Lord&#39;s reward. Here is the assurance which makes preachers bold and workers persevering. Reader, are you one among the many? Note the way of salvation, a sight, a fear, a trust! Do you know what these mean by possessing and practising them in your own soul? Trusting in the Lord is the evidence, nay, the essence of salvation. He who is a true believer is evidently redeemed from the dominion of sin and Satan.</p>
