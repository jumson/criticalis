Like souls in the Popish fabled Purgatory, tossed from burning furnaces into thick ice, so tormented hearts rush from one extreme to the other, with equal torture in each. A heat of fear, a chill of horror, a flaming desire, a horrible insensibility&#8212;by these successive miseries a convinced sinner is brought to death&#39;s door. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sore </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>broken.&quot; </span>Crushed as in a mill, pounded as in a mortar.

The heart learns groanings which cannot be uttered, and the voice fails to tone and tune itself to human speech. When our prayers appear to be rather animal than spiritual, they are none the less prevalent with the pitiful Father of mercy. He hears the murmur of the heart and the roaring of the soul because of sin, and in due time he comes to relieve his afflicted.</p>

Sharp and quick were the beatings of his heart ; he was like a hunted roe, filled with distressing alarms, and ready to fly out of itself with fear. The soul seeks sympathy in sorrow, and if it finds none, its sorrowful heart-throbs are incessant. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faileth </span>me.&quot; What with disease and distraction, he was weakened and ready to expire. A sense of sin, and a clear perception that none can help us in our distress, are enough to bring a man to death&#39;s door, especially if there be none to speak a gentle word, and point the broken spirit to the beloved Physician. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>As </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>light </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eyes, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><i>also </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gone </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&#39;<sup>1</sup>&#39;&#39; </span>Sweet light departed from his bodily eye, and consolation vanished from his soul. Those who were the very light of his eyes forsook him. Hope, the last lamp of night, was ready to go out. What a plight was the poor convict in! Yet here we have some of us been; and here should we have perished had not infinite mercy interposed. Now, as we remember the lovingkindness of the Lord, we see how good it was for us to find our own strength fail us, since it drove us to the strong for strength; and how right it was that our light should all be quenched, that the Lord&#39;s light should be all in all to us.</p>

It is very hard when those who should be the first to come to the rescue, are the first to desert us. In times of deep soul trouble, even the most affectionate friends cannot enter into the sufferer&#39;s case; let them be as anxious as they may, the sores of a tender conscience they cannot bind up. Oh, the loneliness of a soul passing under the convincing power of the Holy Ghost !&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>kinsmen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stand </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>afar </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>off.&#39;<sup>1</sup>&#39;<sup>1</sup> </span>As the women and others of our Lord&#39;s acquaintances from afar gazed on his cross, so a soul wounded for sin sees all mankind as distant spectators, and in the whole crowd finds none to aid. Often relatives hinder seekers after Jesus, oftener still they look on with unconcern, seldom enough do they endeavour to lead the penitent to Jesus.</p>

When they could not act they talked, and when they could not talk they imagined, and schemed, and plotted. Restless is the activity of malice. Bad men never have enough of evil. They compass sea and land to injure a saint ; no labour is too severe, no cost too great if they may utterly destroy the innocent. Our comfort is, that our glorious Head knows the pertinacious malignity of our foes, and will in due season put an end to it, as he even now sets a bound about it.</p>

The English reader must observe, that this word is not the same in the original Hebrew as that which forms the general title of the book of Psalms ; the latter expressing a Hymn of Praise. The word <i>Psalm, </i>however, as used both in the context and in the titles of the individual compositions, is uniformly <span style='font-style:italic;'>Mizmor </span>in the original; a term which accurately defines their poetical character. To explain its proper meaning I must have recourse to the beautiful and accurate definition of Bishop Lowth. &quot;The word <span style='font-style:italic;'>Mizmor </span>signifies a composition, which in a peculiar manner is cut up into sentences, short, frequent, and measured by regular intervals.&quot; . . . He adds that <span style='font-style:italic;'>Zamar </span>means to cut or prune, as applied to the removing super lluous branches from trees; and, after mentioning the secondary sense of the word, &quot;to sing with a voice or instrument,&quot; gives it as his opinion, that <span style='font-style:italic;'>ilizmor </span>may be more properly referred to the primary sense of the root, so as to mean a poem cut up into short sentences, and pruned from all superfluity of words, which is the peculiar characteristic of the Hebrew poetry.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jebb. </span></p>

Among the things which David brought to his own remembrance, the first and foremost were, <span style='font-style:italic;'>CI,) </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>past </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trials </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>past </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deliverances. </span>The great point, however, in David&#39;s Psalm is to bring to remembrance, (2,) <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>depravity </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nature. </span>There is, perhaps, no Psalm which more fully than this describes human nature as seen in the light which God the Holy Ghost casts upon it in the time when he convinces us of sin, I am persuaded that the description here does not tally with any known disease of the body. It is very like leprosy, but it has about it certain features which cannot be found to meet in any leprosy described either by ancient or modern writers. The fact is, it is a spiritual leprosy, it is an inward disease which is here described, and David paints it to the very life, and he would have us to recollect this. A third thing the Psalm brings to our remembrance is, (3,) <span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>many </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemies. </span>David says, that his enemies laid snares for him, and sought his hurt, and spoke mischievous things, and devised and imagined deceits all the day long. &quot;Well,&quot; says one, &quot;how was it that David had so many enemies? How could he make so many? Must he not have been imprudent and rash, or perhaps morose?&quot; It does not appear so in his life. He rather made enemies by his being scrupulously holy. His enemies attacked him, not because he was wicked, but as he says, in this very Psalm, they were his enemies because he loved the thing which is good. The ultimate result of the religion of Christ is to make peace everywhere, but the first result is to cause strife. Further, the Psalm reminds us of, (4.) <span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gracious </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span>Anything which drives us to God is a blessing, and anything which weans us from leaning on an arm of flesh, and especially that weans us from trying to stand alone, is a boon to us.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>II. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>S. </span></p>

They extend both to express the eternity of God&#39;s indignation, even to the binding of the soul and body in eternal chains of darkness. For the first, <span style='font-style:italic;'>jasar, </span>signifies in the Scriptures, <span style='font-style:italic;'>vincire, </span>to bind, often with ropes, often with chains; to fetter, or manacle, or pinion men that are to be executed; so that it imports a slavery, a bondage all the way, and a destruction at last. And so the word is used by Rehoboam, &quot;My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.&quot; 1 Kings xii. 11. And then, the other word, <span style='font-style:italic;'>chamnth, </span>doth not only signify &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>hot </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>displeasure,&quot; </span>but that effect of <span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hot </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>displeasure </span>which is intended by the prophet Esay: &quot;Therefore hath he poured forth his fierce wrath, and the strength of battle, and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew it not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.&quot; These be the fearful conditions of God&#39;s hot displeasure, to be in a furnace, and not to feel it; to be in a habit of sin, and not know what leads us into temptation; to be burnt to ashes, and so not only without all moisture, all holy tears, but, as ashes, without any possibility that any good thing can grow in us. And yet this word, <span style='font-style:italic;'>chamath, </span>hath a heavier signification than this; for it signifies poison itself, destruction itself, for so it is twice taken in one verse: &quot;Their poison is like the poison of a serpent &quot; (Psalm lviii. 4) ; so that this <span style='font-style:italic;'>hot </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>displeasure </span>is that poison of the soul, obduration here, and that extension of that obduration, a final impenitence in this life, and an infinite impenitableness in the next, to die without any actual penitence here, and live without all possibility of future penitence for ever hereafter.

Afflictions often come very speedily, with a glance as an arrow, quick as a thought. 2. Afflictions come suddenly, unexpectedly; an arrow is upon a man afore he is aware, so are afflictions. Though Job saith, the thing he feared came upon him, he looked for this arrow before it came; yet usually afflictions are unlooked-for guests, they thrust in upon us when we dream not of them. 3. They come with little noise; an arrow is felt before, or, as soon as it is heard ; an arrow flies silently and secretly, stealing upon and wounding a man, unobserved and unseen.

But God, like the merciful Samaritan, hath always compassion on such as with sense of their misery are forced to cry out and crave help. Read how Job, chap. vi. and vii.; David, Ps. xxxviii. 3, etc., Hezekiah, Isa. xxxviii. 10, etc., and other like saints poured out their complaints before the Lord, and withal observe what mercy was showed them of the Lord, and you may have in them both good patterns how to behave yourselves in like cases, and good encouragement so to do.

St. Augustine calls these two distinctions or considerations of sin, <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignoran</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tiam, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>et </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>difficultatem</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>first that David was ignorant, that he saw not the tide, as it swelled up upon him, <span style='font-style:italic;'>abyssus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>abyssum, </span>depth called upon depth; and all thy waters, and all thy billows are gone over me (says he in another place) ; he perceived them not coming till they were over him, he discerned not his particular sins then when he committed them, till they came to the <span style='font-style:italic;'>supergressa </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>super, </span>to that height that he was overflowed, surrounded, his iniquities were gone over his head; and in that St. Augustine notes <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorantiam, </span>his unobservance, his inconsiderations of his own case; and then he notes<span style='font-style:italic;'>dijHeultatem, </span>the hardness of recovering, because he that is under water hath no air to see by, no air to hear by, he hath nothing to reach to, he touches not ground, to push him up, he feels no bough to pull him up, and therein that further notes <span style='font-style:italic;'>difficultatem, </span>the hardness of recovering. Now Moses expresses these two miseries together, in the destruction of the Egyptians, in his song, after Israel&#39;s deliverance, and the Egyptians&#39; submersion, &quot;The depths have covered them&quot; (there is the <span style='font-style:italic;'>supergressa </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>super, </span>their iniquities, in that punishment of their iniquities, were gone over their heads), and then, they sank into the bottom like a stone (says Moses), there is the <span style='font-style:italic;'>gravata </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>super, </span>they depressed them, suppressed them, oppressed them, they were under them, and there they must lie.

Spots appear nowhere more disagreeable than when seen in a most beautiful face, or on the cleanest garment. And it is expedient to have a perfect knowledge of the filthiness of sin. We also learn from them to think humbly of ourselves, to depend on the grace of God, to keep a stricter eye upon ourselves, lest perhaps we fall into the same or more grievous sins.

a believing reception and due apprehension of the remedy. Wherever God intends to reveal his Son with power, wherever he intends to make the gospel to be &quot;a joyful sound,&quot; he makes the conscience feel and groan under the burden of sin.

A living man must needs cry under such circumstances. He cannot carry the burden without complaining of its weight. He cannot feel the arrow sticking in his conscience without groaning under the pain. He cannot have the worm gnawing his vitals, without complaining of its venomous tooth. He cannot feel that God is incensed against him without bitterly complaining that the Lord is his enemy. Spiritual complaint then is a mark of spiritual life, and is one which God recognises as such. &quot;I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself.&quot; Jer. xxxi. 18. It shows that he has something to mourn over; something to make him groan being burdened; that sin has been opened up to him in its hateful malignancy; that it is a trouble and distress to his soul ; that he cannot roll it like a sweet morsel under his tongue; but that it is found out by the penetrating eye, and punished by the chastening hand of God.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Philpot.&#8212; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>1&amp;42. </span></span></p>

God well understands the language of half words interrupted with sighs, and interprets them as the steams and breathings of a broken heart. As all our foolishness is before him to cover it, so is all our heaviness to ease it; and therefore shall our souls praise and please him more than a bullock with young horns and hoofs upon his altar. Holy mourning keeps out carnal sorrow and produces spit it joy. It stirs up the heart of B saint to beg preventing grace which no false heart can perform without secret reserves. This inward sorrow prevents open shame. God will never give up <span style='font-style:italic;'>such </span>souls to be trampled on by spiritual enemies, who are already humbled by themselves. In saints&#39; humiliation there&#39;s a door opened for secret hope, because of the precious promises that are lighted to it, and especially of preventing future sin by strengthening grace, or as the love of God is the fountain of all true repentance, so it is the attractive of more incomes of divine love to the soul.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lve. </span></p>

Oh, how happy should we be, if we could always do that which we know is best to be done, and if our wills were as ready to act, as our reason is able to enact ; we should then decline many rocks we now run upon, we should then avoid many errors we now run into.

It is right excellent when a man can strengthen himself in a good course by the remembrance of a well and wisely-formed resolve. &quot;What I have written I have written,&quot; or what I have spoken I will perform, may prove a good strengthener to a man in a fixed course of right. &quot;I <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>take </span><i>heed </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ways.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>To avoid sin one had need be very circumspect, and keep one&#39;s actions as with a guard or garrison.

If believers utter hard words of God in times of depression, the ungodly will take them up and use them as a justification for their sinful courses. If a man&#39;s own children rail at him, no wonder if his enemies&#39; mouths are full of abuse. Our tongue always wants watching, for it is restive as an ill-broken horse; but especially must we hold it in when the sharp cuts of the Lord&#39;s rod excite it to rebel. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><i>keep </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mouth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bridle,&quot; </span>or more accurately, with a muzzle. The original does not so much mean a bridle to check the tongue as a muzzle to stop it altogether. David was not quite so wise as our translation would make him ; if he had resolved to be very guarded in his speech, it would have been altogether commendable; but when he went so far as to condemn himself to entire silence, &quot;even from good,&quot; there must have<a id='GBS.PA239.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.254.1.0.box.185.292.1307.673.q.60'>
been at least a little sullenness in his soul. In trying to avoid one fault, he fell into another. To use the tongue against God is a sin of commission, but not to use it at all involves an evident sin of omission. Commendable virtues may be followed so eagerly that we may fall into vices; to avoid Scylla we run into Charybdis. &quot;<i>While </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wicked </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><i>before </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.</span>&quot; This qualifies the silence, and almost screens it from criticism, for bad men are so sure to misuse even our holiest speech, that it is as well not to cast any of our pearls before such swine; but what if the psalmist meant, &quot;I was silent while I had the prosperity of the wicked in my thoughts,&quot; then we see the discontent and questioning of his mind, and the muzzled mouth indicates much that is not to be commended. Yet, if we blame we must also praise, for the highest wisdom suggests that when good men are bewildered with sceptical thoughts, they should not hasten to repeat them, but should fight out their inward battle upon its own battlefield. The firmest believers are exercised with unbelief, and it would be doing the devil&#39;s work with a vengeance if they were to publish abroad all their questionings and suspicions. If I have the fever myself, there is no reason why I should communicate it to my neighbours. If any on board the vessel of my soul are diseased, I will put my heart in quarantine, and allow none to go on shore in the boat of speech till I have a clean bill of health.</span></p>

He was as silent as the dumb. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>held </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>peace, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><i>good.&quot; </i>Neither bad nor good escaped his lips. Perhaps he feared that if he began to talk at all, he would be sure to speak amiss, and, therefore, he totally abstained. It was an easy, safe, and effectual way of avoiding sin, if it did not involve a neglect of the duty which he owed to God to speak well of his name. Our divine Lord was silent before the wicked, but not altogether so, for before Pontius Pilate he witnessed a good confession, and asserted his kingdom. A sound course of action may be pushed to the extreme, and become a fault. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sorrow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stirred.&#39;&#39; </span>Inward grief was made to work and ferment by want of vent. The peut-up floods are swollen and agitated. Utterance is the natural outlet for the heart&#39;s anguish, and silence is, therefore, both an aggravation of the evil and a barrier against its cure. In such a case the resolve to hold one&#39;s peace needs powerful backing, and even this is most likely to give way when grief rushes upon the soul. Before a flood gathering in force and foaming for outlet the strongest banks are likely to be swept away. Nature may do her best to silence the expression of discontent, but unless grace comes to her rescue, she will be sure to succumb.</p>
