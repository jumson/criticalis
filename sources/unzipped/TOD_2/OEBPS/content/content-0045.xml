A simple single-eyed confidence in God is the sure mark of blessedness. A man may be as poor as Lazarus, as hated as Mordecai, as sick as Hezekiah, as lonely as Elijah, but while his hand of faith can keep its hold on God, none of his outward afflictions can prevent his being numbered among the blessed : but the wealthiest and most prosperous man who has no faith is accursed, be he who he may. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>re</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>specteth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>proud.&quot; </span>The proud expect all men to bow down and do them reverence, as if the worship of the golden calves were again set up in Israel; but believing men are too noble to honour mere money-bags, or cringe before bombastic dignity. The righteous pay their respect to humble goodness, rather than to inflated self-consequence. Our Lord Jesus was in this our bright example. No flattery of kings and great ones ever fell from his lips; he gave no honour to dishonourable men. The haughty were never his favourites. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Nor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>such </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>turn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>aside </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lies.&quot; </span>Heresies and idolatries are lies, and so are avarice, worldliness, and pleasure-seeking. Woe to those who follow such deceptions. Our Lord was ever both the truth and the lover of truth, and the father of lies had no part in him. We must never pay deference to apostates, time-servers, and false teachers ; they are an ill leaven, and the more we purge ourselves of them the better: they are blessed whom God preserves from all error in creed and practice. fJudged by this verse, many apparently happy persons must be the reverse of blessed, for anything in the shape of a purse, a fine equipage, or a wealthy establishment, commands their reverence, whether the owner be a rake or a saint, an idiot or a philosopher. Verily, were the arch-fiend of hell to start a carriage and pair, and live like a lord, he would have thousands who would court his acquaintanceTS</p>

Our special attention is called by this passage to the marvels which cluster around the cross and flash from it. The accomplished redemption achieves many ends, and compasses a variety of designs; the outgoings of the atonement are not to be reckoned up, the influences of the cross reach further than the beams of the sun. Wonders of grace beyond all enumeration take their rise from the cross; adoption, pardon, justification, and a long chain of godlike miracles of love proceed from it. Note that our Lord here speaks of the Lord as &quot; my God.&quot; The man Christ Jesus claimed for himself and us a covenant relationship with Jehovah. Let our interest in our God be ever to as our peculiar treasure, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thoughts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us-ward.&quot; </span>The divine thoughts march with the divine acts, for it is not according to God&#39;s wisdom to act without deliberation and counsel. All the divine thoughts are good and gracious towards his elect, God&#39;s thoughts of love are very many, very wonderful, very practical! Muse on them, dear reader; no sweeter subject ever occupied your mind. God&#39;s thoughts of you are many, let not yours be few in return. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cannot </span><i>be </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>reckoned </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>order </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>Their sum is so great as to forbid alike analysis and numeration. Human minds fail to measure, or to arrange in order, the Lord&#39;s ways and thoughts; and it must always be so, for he hath said, &quot;As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&quot; No maze to lose oneself in like the labyrinth of love. How sweet to be outdone, overcome and overwhelmed by the astonishing grace of the Lord our God! <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;If </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>would </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>declare </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>speak </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them,&quot; </span>and surely this should be the occupation of my tongue at all seasonable opportunities, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><a id='GBS.PA264.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.279.1.0.box.264.299.1297.251.q.60'>

Yet, if we cannot show forth all the works of the Lord, let us not make this an excuse for silence; for our Lord, who is in this our best example, often spoke of the tender thoughts of the great Father.</span></p>

Here we enter upon one of the most wonderful passages in the whole of the Old Testament, a passage in which the incarnate Son of God is seen not through a glass darkly, but as it were face to face. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>8aer{five </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>offering </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>didst </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>desire.&quot; </span>In themselves considered, and for their own sakes, the Lord saw nothing satisfactory in the various offerings of the ceremonial law. Neither the victim pouring forth its blood, nor the fine flour rising in smoke from the altar, could yield content to Jehovah&#39;s mind; he cared not for the flesh of bulls or of goats, neither had he pleasure in corn and wine, and oil. Typically these offerings had their worth, but when Jesus, the Antitype, came into the world, they ceased to be of value, as candles are of no estimation when the sun has arisen. <i>&quot;Mine </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>earn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>opened.&quot; </span>Our Lord was quick to hear and perform his Father&#39;s will ; his ears were as if excavated down to his soul; they were not closed up like Isaac&#39;s wells, which the Philistines filled up, but clear passages down to the fountains of his soul. The prompt obedience of our Lord is here the first idea. There is, however, no reason whatever to reject the notion that the digging of the ear here intended may refer to the boring of the ear of the servant, who refused out of love to his master to take his liberty at the year of jubilee; his perforated ear, the token of perpetual service, is a true picture of cur blessed Lord&#39;s fidelity to his Father&#39;s business, and his love to his Father&#39;s children. Jesus irrevocably gave himself up to be the servant of servants for our sake and God&#39;s glory. The Septuagint, from which Paul quoted, has translated this passage, &quot;A body hast thou prepared me:&quot; how this reading arose it is not easy to imagine, but since apostolical authority has sanctioned the variation, we accept it as no mistake, but as an instance of various readings equally inspired. In any case, the passage represents the Only Begotten as coming into the world equipped for service ; and in a real and material body, by actual life and death, putting aside all the shadows of the Mosaic law. <i>&quot;Burnt </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>offering </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>offering </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><i>required.&quot; </i>Two other forms of offering are here mentioned; tokens of gratitude and sacrifices for sin as typically presented are set aside; neither the general nor the private offerings are any longer demanded. What need of mere emblems when the substance itself is present? We learn from this verse that Jehovah values far more the obedience of the heart than all the imposing performances of ritualistic worship; and that our expiation from sin comes not to us as the result of an elaborate ceremonial, but as the effect of our great Substitute&#39;s obedience to the will of Jehovah.</p>

Here is something worthy of your intensest gaze.

The mystic roll of predestination which providence gradually unfolds, contained within it. to the Saviour&#39;s knowledge, a written covenant, that in the fulness of time the divine I should descend to earth to accomplish a purpose which hecatombs of bullocks and rams could not achieve. What a privilege to find our names written in the book of life, and what an honour, since the name of Jesus heads the page! Our Lord had respect to his ancient covenant engagements, and herein he teaches us to be scrupulously just in keeping our word; have we so promised, is it so written in the book of remembrance? then let us never be defaulters.</p>

The law is too broad for such poor creatures as we are to hope to fulfil it to the uttermost: but Jesus not only did the Father&#39;s will, but found a delight therein.; from old eternity he had desired the work set before him ; in his human life he was straitened till he reached the baptism of agony in which he magnified the law, and even in Gethsemane itself he chose the Father&#39;s will, and set aside his own. Herein is the essence of obedience, namely, in the soul&#39;s cheerful devotion to God : and our Lord&#39;s obedience, which is our righteousness, is in no measure lacking in this eminent quality. Notwithstanding his measureless griefs, our Lord found delight in his work, and for &quot; the joy that was set before him he endured the cross, despising the shame.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Yea, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><i>fate </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>within </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&quot; </span>No outward, formal devotion was rendered by Christ; his heart was in his work, holiness was his element, the Father&#39;s will his meat and drink. We must each of us be like our Lord in this, or we shall lack the evidence of being his disciples. Where there is no heart work, no pleasure, no delight in God&#39;s law, there can be no acceptance. Let the devout reader adore the Saviour for the spontaneous and hearty manner in which he undertook the great work of our salvation.</p>

Righteousness divine was his theme. Our Lord&#39;s whole life was a sermon; eloquent beyond compare, and it is heard each day by myriads. Moreover, he never shunned in his ministry to declare the whole counsel of God ; God&#39;s great plan of righteousness he plainly set forth. He taught openly in the temple, and was not ashamed to be a faithful and a true witness. He was the gteat evangelist; the master of itinerant preachers; the head of the clan of open-air missionaries. O servants of the . Lord, hide not your lights, but reveal to others what your God has revealed to you; and especially by your lives testify for holiness, be champions for the right, both in word and deed. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Lo, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>refrained </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lips, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>O </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>knmrrst.&quot; </span>Never either from love of ease, or fear of men, did the Great Teacher&#39;s lips become closed.

It is well for a tried believer when he can appeal to God and call him to witness that he has not been ashamed to bear witness for him; for rest assured if we are not ashamed to confess our God, he will never be ashamed to own us. Yet what ll wonder is here, that the Son of God should plead, just as we plead, and urge just</p>

Concealment was far from the Great Apostle of our profession. Cowardice he never exhibited, hesitancy never weakened his language. He who as a child of twelve years spake in the temple among the doctors, and afterwards preached to five thousand at Gennesaret, and to the vast crowds at Jerusalem on that great day, the last day of the feast, was always ready to proclaim the name of the Lord, and could never be charged with unholy silence. He could be dumb when so the prophecy demanded and patience suggested, but otherwise, preaching was his meat and his drink, and he kept back nothing which would be profitable to his disciples. This in the day of his trouble, according to this Psalm, he used as a plea for divine aid. He had been faithful to his God, and now begs the Lord to be faithful to him. Let every dumb professor, tongue-tied by sinful shame, bethink himself how little he will be able to plead after this fashion in the day of his distress.</p>

verse might more correctly be read as a declaration of his confidence that help would not be refused ; but whether we view this utterance as the cry of prayer, or the avowal of faith, in either case it is instructive to us who take our suffering Lord for an example, and it proves to us how thoroughly he was made like unto his brethren. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>IM </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lovingkindness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>continually </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preserve </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>He had preached both of these, and now he asks for an experience of them, that he might be kept in the evil day and rescued from his enemies and his afflictions.

Let seeking souls pluck up heart when they hear of this. What riches of grace, that in his bitterest hour Jesus should remember the lambs of the flock! And what does he entreat for them? it is that they may be doubly glad, intensely happy, emphatically joyful, for such the repetition of terms implies. Jesus would have all seekers made happy by finding what they seek after, and by winning peace through his grief. As deep as were his sorrows, so high would he have their joys.

Our Lord&#39;s desire should be our directory ; we love with all our hearts his great salvation, let us then, with all our tongues proclaim the glory of God which is resplendent therein. Never let his praises cease. As the heart is warm with gladness let it incite the tongue to perpetual praise. If we cannot do what we would for the spread of the kingdom, at least let us desire and pray for it. Be it ours to make God&#39;s glory the chief end of every breath and pulse. The suffering Redeemer regarded the consecration of his people to the service of heaven as a grand result of his atoning death; it is the joy which was set before him; that God is glorified is the reward of the Saviour&#39;s travail.</p>

He rcpresenteth himself as praying, while under his sufferings, for his own, and his people&#39;s salvation ; he foretelleth, 14, 15, the confusion and desolation of his enemies, and, 16, the joy and thankfulness of his disciples and servants; for the speedy accomplishment of which, 17, he prefcrreth a petition.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Horne. </span></p>

I shall give a certain argument, whereby thou may know that the Lord heareth thee, suppose he delay the effect of thy prayers. Continuest thou in prayer? Hast thou his strength given thee to persevere in suiting * anything? Thou may be assured he heareth; for this is one sure argument that he heareth thee, for naturallie our impatience carrieth us to desperation; our suddenness is so great, speciallie in spiritual troubles, that we cannot continue in suiting. When thou, therefore, continues in suiting, thou may be sure that this strength is furnished of God, and cometh from heaven, and if thou have strength, he letteth thee see that he heareth thy prayer; and suppose he delay the effect and force thereof, yet pray continuallie. This doctrine is so necessary for the troubled conscience, that I think it is the meetest bridle in the Scripture to refrain our impatience; it is the meetest bit to hold us in continual exercise of patience; for if the heart understand that the Lord hath rejected our prayer altogether, it is not possible to continue in prayer; so when we know that the Lord heareth us, suppose he delay, let us crave patience to abide his good will.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bruce, </span>1559&#8212;1631.</p>

I answer, therefore, That the life of the quotation lies not in the words of difference, nor can do, because this epistle was written to the Hebrews, and so first in the Hebrew tongue, where this translation of the LXX could have no place. And if the life of the quotation lay here, I cannot see how it can possibly be reconciled. It lies therefore in the &quot;words where there is no difference, namely, That Christ was such a High Priest as came to sanctify us, not with legal offerings and sacrifices, but by his obedience in doing like a devoted servant the will of his Father. Thus, the allegation will not depend at all upon the words of difference, and so they give us liberty to reconcile them: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Mine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ears </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bored,&quot;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>saith the psalmist, i.e., Thou hast accepted me for a perpetual servant, as masters are wont, according to the law, to <span style='font-style:italic;'>bore </span>such servants&#39; <span style='font-style:italic;'>ears </span>as refuse to part from them. Now the LXX, according to whom the apostle&#39;s epistle readeth, thinking perhaps the meaning of this speech would be obscure to such as knew not that custom, chose rather to translate it generally <span style='font-style:italic;'>cu/ia </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>61 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>KariiiiTiau </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>/ioi. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fitted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>body,&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>namely, to be thy servant, in such a manner as servants&#39; bodies are wont to be.

The passage is, that &quot; when Christ came into the world,&quot; to take our nature on him, he alleged the reason of it to be the fulfilling of a Scripture written in &quot; the beginning of God&#39;s book,&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>iv </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kttpa?.iiU </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bij3?im; </span>so out of the original the words may be, and are by many interpreters, translated, though our translation reads them only thus, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>volume </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>book </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>written </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span>me. &quot; It is true, indeed, that in the fortieth Psalm, whence they are quoted, the words in the Hebrew may signify no more than that in God&#39;s book (the manner of writing which was anciently in rolls of parchment, folded up in a volume) Christ was everywhere written and spoken of. Yet the word *FtsaXis, which out of the Septuagint&#39;s translation the apostle took, signifying, as all know, the beginning of a book; and we finding such an emphasis set by the apostle in the fifth chapter of the Ephesians, upon the history of Adam in the beginning of Genesis, as containing the mystery, yea, the great mystery about Christ, it did somewhat induce, though not so fully persuade, me to think, that the Holy Ghost in those words might have some glance at the story of Adam in the first of the first book of Moses. And withal the rather because so, the words so understood do intimate a higher and further inducement to Christ to assume our nature, the scope of the speech, Heb. x., being to render the reason why he so willingly took man&#39;s nature: not only because God liked not sacrifice and burnt-offering, which came in but upon occasion of sin, and after the fall, and could not take sins away, but further, that he was prophesied of, and his assuming a body prophetically foresignified, as in the fortieth Psalm, so even by Adam&#39;s story before the fall, recorded in the very beginning of Genesis, which many other Scriptures do expressly apply it unto.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

It is said, Prov. viii. 31, when he was solacing himself in the sweetest enjoyment of his Father, whilst he lay in that blessed bosom of delights, yet the very prospect of this work gave him pleasure, then his &quot; delights were with the sons of men.&quot; And when he was come into the world, and had endured many abuses and injuries, and was even now come to the most difficult part of the work ; yet, &quot;how am I straitened, or pained (saith he), till it be accomplished!&quot; Luke xii. 50. Two things call our thoughts to stay upon them in this point. First.&#8212;The <span style='font-style:italic;'>decency </span>of it&#8212; why it ought to be so. 1.&#8212;It became Christ to go about this work with cheerfulness and delight, that thereby he might give his death the nature and formality of a sacrifice. In all sacrifices you shall find that God had still a regard, a special respect to the will of the offerer. See Exod. xxxv.</p>

That he came into the world to die for us is a mercy of the first magnitude; but that he came in love to our souls, and underwent all his sufferings with such willingness for our sakes, this heightens it above all apprehension. 4.&#8212;It was necessary to be so for the regulating of all our obedience to God, according to this pattern; that seeing and setting this great example of obedience before us, we might never grudge nor grumble at any duty or suffering that God should call us to. <span style='font-style:italic;'>/Secondly.</span>&#8212;Let us consider and examine whence it came to be so pleasant and acceptable to Jesus Christ, to come into the world and die for poor sinners. 1.&#8212;That in his sufferings there would be made a glorious display and manifestation of the divine attributes. 2.&#8212;Another delightful prospect Christ had of the fruit of his sufferings, was the recovery and salvation of all the elect by his death; and though his sufferings were exceedingly bitter, yet such fruit of them as this was exceedingly sweet. 3.&#8212;Add to this, the glory which would redound to him from his redeemed ones to all eternity, for it will be the everlasting employment of the saints in heaven to be ascribing glory, praise, and honour to the Redeemer. Did Christ find pleasure in abusement and torment, in suffering and dying for me, and can I find no pleasure in praying, hearing, meditating, and enjoying the sweet duties of communion with him? Did he come so cheerfully to die for me, and do I go so deadhearted ly to prayers and sacraments to enjoy fellowship with him? Was it a pleasure to him to shed his blood, and is it none to me to apply it, and reap the benefits of it? O let there be no more grumblings, lazy excuses, shiftings of duty, or dead-hearted and listless performances of them, after such an example as this. Be ready to do the will of God, be ye also ready to suffer it. And as to sufferings for Christ, they should not be grievous to Christians that know how cheerfully Christ came from the bosom of the Father to die for them. What have we to leave or lose, in comparison with him? What are our sufferings to Christ&#39;s? Alas! there is no compare; there was more bitterness in one drop of his sufferings than in a sea of ours.

He was great&#8212;1. In <span style='font-style:italic;'>genuine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eloquence. </span>All the handmaids of the choicest rhetoric ministered to him as he spake. His mind touched the minds of his auditors on all sides. 2.

He was great also in <span style='font-style:italic;'>goodness. </span>There is a greatness in goodness, and the greatness of goodness is an important element in the greatness of a preacher. 4. Jesus was great, too, in <span style='font-style:italic;'>official </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>status. </span>Official status, whether in things civil, literary, or sacred, when conferred on worthy individuals, confers, in its turn, undoubted weight and mornl authority. Now Jesus was the highest official in the universe. His authority extended to all other officebearers, his office exceeded all other offices. He came from above, and was &quot;above all.&quot; He was Lord of lords, and King of kings. 5. Another element still in the greatness of Jesus, as a preacher, consisted in the greatness of his <span style='font-style:italic;'>essential </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dignity. </span>He was God as well as man. Such was Christ as a preacher. True he was more than a preacher; he was likewise a pattern, and a priest, and a propitiator; and as pattern, priest, and propitiator, he stands without a peer. But he was a preacher, too, and as a preacher, he has never had, and never will have an equal. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Condensed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Frame. </span></p>

It may astonish any considering man to take notice how many sins he is guilty of any one day; how many sins accompany any one single act; nay, how many bewray themselves in any one religious duty. Whensoever ye do anything forbidden, you omit the duty at that time commanded ; and whenever you neglect that which is enjoined, the omission is joined with the acting of something forbidden ; so that the sin, whether omission or commission, is always double; nay, the apostle makes every sin tenfold. James ii. 10. That which seems one to us, according to the sense of the law, and the account of God, is multiplied by ten. He breaks every command by sinning directly against one, and so sins ten times at once; besides that swarm of sinful circumstances and aggravations which surround every act in such numbers, as atoms use to surround your body in a dusty room; you may more easily number these than those. And though some count these but fractions, incomplete sins, yet even from hence it is more difficult to take an account of their number. And, which is more for astonishment, pick out the best religious duty that ever you performed, and even in that performance you may find such a swarm of sins as cannot be numbered. In the best prayer that ever you put up to God, irreverence, lukewarmness, unbelief, spiritual pride, self-seeking, hypocrisy, distractions, etc., and many more, that an enlightened soul grieves and bewails; and yet there are many more that the pure eye of God discerns, than any man does take notice of.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>David </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Clarkson. </span></p>

Perhaps, while you are thinking of his safety, some enemy is taking advantage of his innocency. Perhaps, while you are rejoicing in his prudence, he is going to take a step that will involve him for life.

To search the word of God comes first, pardoned sin is second, and now the forgiven sinner brings forth fruit unto God available for the good of others. The word used is as emphatic as in the former cases, and so is the blessing which follows it. The poor intended, are such as are poor in substance, weak in bodily strength, despised in repute, and desponding in spirit. These are mostly avoided and frequently scorned. The worldly proverb bequeaths the hindmost to one who has no mercy. The sick and the sorry are poor company, and the world deserts them as the Amalekite left his dying servant. Such as have been made partakers of divine grace receive a tenderer nature, and are not hardened against their own flesh and blood ; they undertake the cause of the downtrodden, and turn their minds seriously to the promotion of their welfare. They do not toss them a penny and go on their way, but enquire into their sorrows, sift out their cause, study the best ways for their relief, and practically come to their rescue; such as these have the mark of the divine favour plainly upon them, and are as surely the sheep of the Lord&#39;s pasture as if they wore a brand upon their<a id='GBS.PA284.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.299.1.0.box.238.283.1293.389.q.60'>

First and foremost, yea, far above all others put together in tender compassion for the needy is our Lord Jesus, who so remembered our low estate, that though he was rich, for our sakes he became poor. All his attributes were charged with the task of our uplifting. He weighed our case and came in the fulness of wisdom to execute the wonderful work of mercy by which we are redeemed from our destructions. Wretchedness excited his pity, misery moved his mercy, and thrice blessed is he both by his God and his saints for his attentive care and wise action towards us. He still considereth us; his mercy is always in the present tense, and so let our praises be.</span></p>

God measures to us with our own bushel. Days of trouble come even to the most generous, and they have made the wisest provision for rainy days who have lent shelter to others when times were better with them. The promise is not that the generous saint shall have no trouble, but that he shall be preserved in it, and in due time brought out of it. How true was this of our Lord! never trouble deeper nor triumph brighter than his, and glory be to his name, he secures the ultimate victory of all his blood-bought ones. Would that they all were more like him in putting on bowels of compassion to the poor. Much blessedness they miss who stint their alms. The joy of doing good, the sweet reaction of another&#39;s happiness, the approving smile of heaven upon the heart, if not upon the estate; all these the niggardly soul knows nothing of. Selfishness bears in itself a curse, it is a cancer in.^lie heart; while liberality is happiness, and maketh fat the bones. In 3ark ditys&quot; we cannot rest upon the supposed merit of almsgiving, but still the music of memory brings with it no mean solace when it tells of widows and orphans whom we have succoured, and prisoners and sick folk to whom we have ministered.</p>

Jesus lived on till his hour came, nor could the devices of crafty Herod take away his life till the destined hour had struck; and even then no man took his life from him, but he laid it down of himself, to take it again. Here is the portion of all those who are made like their Lord, they bless and they shall be blessed, they preserve and shall be preserved, they watch over the lives of others and they themselves shall be precious in the sight of the Lord. The miser like the hog is of no use till he is dead&#8212;then let him die ; the righteous like the ox is of service during life&#8212;then let him live. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth.&quot; </span>Prosperity shall attend him. His cruse of oil shall not be dried up because he fed the poor prophet. He shall cut from his roll of cloth and find it longer at both ends.</p>

His little shall be blessed, bread and water shall be a feast to him. The liberal are and must be blessed even here; they have a present as well as a future portion. Our Lord&#39;s real blessedness of heart in the joy that was set before him is a subject worthy of earnest thought, especially as it is the picture of the blessing which all liberal saints may look for. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wilt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deliver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><i>unto </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemies.&quot; </span>He helped the distressed, and now he shall find a champion in his God. What would not the good man&#39;s enemies do to him if they had him at their disposal? Better be in a pit with vipers than be at the mercy of persecutors. This sentence sets before us a sweet negative, and yet it were not easy to have seen how it could be true of our Lord Jesus, did we not know that although he was exempted from much of blessing, being made a curse for us, yet even he was not altogether nor for ever left of God, but in due time was exalted above all his enemies.</p>
