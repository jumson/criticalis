In the sense of our translation it is a most potent argument to urge with our Lord that the cause of the true, the humble, and the good, calls for his advocacy. Truth will be ridiculed, meekness will be oppressed, and righteousness slain, unless the God, the Man in whom these precious things are incarnated, shall arise for their vindication. Our earnest petition ought ever to be that Jesus would lay his almighty arm to the work of grace lest the good cause languish and wickedness prevail. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>right </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>teach </span><i>thee </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>terrible </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>things.&quot; </span>Foreseeing the result of divine working, the psalmist prophesies that the uplifted arm of Messiah will reveal to the King&#39;s own eyes the terrible overthrow of his foes. Jesus needs no guide but his own right hand, no teacher but his own might; may he instruct us all in what he can perform, by achieving it speedily before our gladdened eyes.</p>

Whether for love or vengeance, Christ never misses aim, and when his arrows stick, they cause it smart not soon forgotten, a wound which only he can heal. Jesus&#39; arrows of conviction are -sharp in the quiver of his word, and sharp when on the bow of his ministers, but they are most known to be so when they find a way into careless hearts. They are <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>arrows, he made them, he shoots them. He makes them sharp, and he makes them enter the heart. May none of us ever fall under the darts of his judgment, for none kill so surely as they. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Whereby </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>under </span><i>thee.&quot; </i>On either side the slain of the Lord are many when Jesus deads on the war. Nations tremble and turn to him when he shoots abroad his truth. Under his power and presence, men are stricken down as though pricked in the heart. There is no standing against the Son of God when his bow of might is in his hands. Terrible will be that hour when his bow shall be made quite naked, and bolts of devouring fire shall be hurled upon his adversaries: then shall princes fall and nations perish.</p>

The psalmist cannot restrain his adoration. His enlightened eye sees in the royal Husband of the church, God, God to be adored, God reigning, God reigning everlastingly. Blessed sight! Blind are the eyes that cannot see God in Christ Jesus! We never appreciate the tender condescension of our King in becoming one flesh with his church, and placing her at his right hand, until we have fully rejoiced in his essential glory and deity. What a mercy for us that our Saviour is God, for who but a God could execute the work of salvation? What a glad thing it is that he reigns on a throne which will never pass away, for we need both sovereign grace and eternal love to secure our happiness. Could Jesus cease to reign we should cease to be blessed, and were he not God, and therefore eternal, this must be the case. No throne can endure for ever, but that on which God himself sitteth. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sceptre </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>kingdom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>right </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sceptre.&quot; </span>He is the lawful monarch of all things that be. His rule is founded in right, its law is right, its result is right. Our King is no usurper and no oppressor. Even when he shall break his enemies with a rod of iron, he will do no man wrong; his vengeance and his grace are both in conformity with justice. Hence we trust him without suspicion; he cannot err; no affliction is too severe, for he sends it; no judgment too harsh, for he ordains it.

What qualifications for a sovereign! what grounds of confidence for a people! The whole of our Lord&#39;s life on earth proved the truth of these words; his death to put away sin and bring in the reign of righteousness, sealed the fact beyond all question ; his providence by which he rules from his mediatorial throne, when rightly understood, reveals the same ; and his final assize will proclaim it before all worlds. We should imitate him both in his love and hate; they are both needful to complete a righteous character. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Therefore </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anointed </span><i>that, </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>oil </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gladness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ahore </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fellows.&quot; </span>Jesus as Mediator owned God as his God, to w hom, being found in fashion as a man, he became obedient. On account of our Lord&#39;s perfect life he is now rewarded with superior joy. Others there are to whom grace has given a sacred fellowship with him, but by their universal consent and his own merit, he is prince among them, the gladdest of all be cause the cause of all their gladness. At Oriental feasts oil was poured on the heads of distinguished and very welcome guests; God himself anoints the man Christ Jesus, as he sits at the heavenly feasts, anoints him as a reward for his work, with higher and fuller joy than any else can know ; thus is the Son of man honoured and rewarded for all his pains. Observe the indisputable testimony to Messiah&#39;s Deity in verse six, and to his manhood in the present verse. Of whom could this be written but of Jesus of Nazareth? Our Christ is our Elohim. Jesus is God with us.</p>

He is delightful to every sense, to the eye most fair, to the car most gracious, to the spiritual nostril most sweet. The excellences of Jesus are all most precious, comparable to the rarest spices; they aie most varied, and to be likened not to myrrh alone, but to all the perfumes blended in due proportion. The Father always finds a pleasure in him, in him he is well pleased ; and all regenerated spirits rejoice in him, for he is made of God unto us, &quot;wisdom, righteousness. sanctification, and redemption.&quot; Note that not only is Jesus most sweet, but even his garments are so; everything that he has to do with is perfumed by his person. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;All </span>&quot; his garments are thus fragrant; not some of them, but all; we delight as much in his purple of dominion as in the white linen of his priesthood, his mantle as our prophet is as dear to us as his seamless coat as our friend. All his dress is fragrant with all sweetness. To attempt to spiritualise each spice here mentioned would be unprofitable, the evident sense is that all sweetnesses meet in Jesus, and are poured forth wherever he is present. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ivory </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>palaces, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whereby </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span><i>thee </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>glad.&quot; </span>The abode of Jesus now is imperial in splendour, ivory and gold but faintly image his royal seat; there is he made glad in the presence of the Father, and in the company of his saints. Oh, to behold him with his perfumed garments on! The very smell of him from afar ravishes our spirit, what must it be to be on the other side of the pearl gate, within the palace of ivory, amid those halls of Zion. &quot;conjubilant with song,&quot; where is the throne of David, and the abiding presence of the Prince! To think of his gladness, to know that <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span>is full of joy, gives gladness at this moment to our semis. We poor exiles can sing in our banishment since our King, our Wellbeloved, has come to his throne.</p>

Gold is the richest of metals, and Ophir gold the purest known. Jesus bestows nothing inferior or of secondary value upon his beloved church. In imparted ana imputed righteousness the church is divinely arrayed. Happy those who are members of a church so honoured, so beloved ; unhappy those who persecute the beloved people, for as a husband will not endure that his wife should be insulted or maltreated, so neither will the heavenly Husband; he will speedily avenge his own elect. Mark, then, the solemn pomp of the verses we have read. The King is seen with rapture, he girds himself as a warrior, robes himself as a monarch, mounts his chariot, darts his arrows, and conquers his foes. Then he ascends his throne with his sceptre in his hand, fills the palace hall with perfume brought from his secret chambers, his retinue stand around him, and, fairest of all, his bride is at his right hand, with daughters of subject princes as her attendants. Faith is no stranger to this sight, and every time she looks she adores, she loves, she rejoices, she expects.</span></p>

Evil acquaintances, and even those who are but neutral, must be forsaken, they can confer no benefit, they must inflict injury. The house of our nativity is the house of sin&#8212;we were shapen in iniquity; the carnal mind is enmity against God, we must come forth of the house of fallen nature, for it is built in the City of Destruction. Not that natural ties are broken by grace, but ties of the sinful nature, bonds of graceless affinity. We have much to forget as well as to learn, and the unlearning is so difficult that only diligent hearing, and considering, and bending of the whole soul to it, can accomplish the work ; and even these would be too feeble did not divine grace assist. Yet why should we remember the Egypt from which we came out? Are the leeks and the garlic, and the onions anything, when the iron bondage, and the slavish tasks, and the death-dealing Pharaoh of hell are remembered? We part with folly for wisdom; with bubbles for eternal joys; with deceit for truth ; with misery for bliss; with idols for the living God. O that Christians were more mindful of the divine precept here recorded ; but, alas! worldliness abounds; the church is defiled ; and the glory of the Great King is veiled. Only when the whole church leads the separated life will the full splendour and power of Christianity shine forth upon the world.</p>

sees a beauty in his church, a beauty which he delights in most when it is not marred by worldliness. He has always been most near and precious to his saints when they have cheerfully taken up his cross and followed him without the camp. His Spirit is grieved when they mingle themselves among the people and learn their ways. No great and lasting revival of religion can be granted us till the professed lovers of Jesus prove their affection by coming out from an ungodly world, being separated, and touching not the unclean thing. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Fur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>arul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>worship </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him.&#39;&#39; </span>He has royal rights 6till; his condescending grace does not lessen but rather enforce his authority.

The church must reverence Jesus, and bow before him in prostrate adoration; his tender union with her gives her liberty, but not license; it frees her from all other burdens, but places his easy yoke upon her neck. Who would wish it to be otherwise? The service of God is heaven in heaven, and perfectly carried out it is heaven upon earth. Jesus, thou art he whom thy church praises in her unceasing songs, and adores in her perpetual service. Teach us to be wholly thine. Bear with us, and work by thy Spirit in us till thy will is done by us on earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>

We go about to beg for Christ like beggars for alms, and many who should know better will mukl compromises and become reticent of unpopular truth to please the great ones of the earth: not so will the true bride of Christ degrade herself, when her sanctification is more deep and more visible ; then will the hearts of men grow liberal, and offerings from afar, abundant and continual, shall be presented at the throne of the Pacific Prince.</p>

The Psalms which bear this title, &quot; upon lilies,&quot; are the present, the sixtyninth and the eightieth (cp. Ps. lx.) ; and all these contain prophecies of Christ and his church. The sixtieth is a parallel to the forty-fourth, and represents her supplicating appeal to God, and Christ&#39;s victories. The sixty-ninth displays the victories gained by Christ through suffering. The eightieth is also parallel to the forty-fourth and sixtieth, a plaintive lament of the church in distress and a supplicating cry for deliverance. All these three Psalms are (if we may venture to use this expression) like the voice of the &quot;lily among thorns.&quot; That there is, therefore, some reference here to the spiritual meaning of the word OTtfitf, or <span style='font-style:italic;'>lilies, </span>in this title, seems at least to be probable.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Christopher </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wordswoiih. </span></p>

He takes his people&#39;s sins upon him, and they receive the right to become the sons of God: the One Spirit of God wherewith he was baptised without measure, dwells in them according to the measure of the grace that is given them. I will only add further, that this union, besides being implied in so many places, is expressly set forth in one most glorious Psalm&#8212;the Nuptial Song of Christ and the Church&#8212;which has for its peculiar theme the home-bringing of Christ&#39;s elect, that they may be joined to him in a union that shall survive the everlasting hills.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Binnie, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D.D. </span></p>

Here, therefore, you have some insight given you of the manner of the operation of the Spirit in the heart of man. The psalmist says his heart is doing what the spirit is doing in his heart. The heart does it, indeed, but it is the Spirit&#39;s working. The psalmist took all the interest and pleasure in his subject that he could have done, if the Spirit had had nothing to do with it; for when the Spirit works, he woi ks not only by the heart, but in the heart; he seizes upon all its affections, every fibre of it is bent to his will.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Harpur, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Christ </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psalms,&quot; </span>1862.</p>

Solomon is type here, but Christ is the truth ; and this showeth evidently that Christ is not a tyrant, but a mild prince, persuading obedience plausibly, not compelling his people violently; his sayings are his <span style='font-style:italic;'>sceptre </span>and his sword : his piercing exhortations are, as it were, his <span style='font-style:italic;'>sharp </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>arrows </span>by which his followers are subdued unto him.</p>

Read over all the books of love and friendship that were ever written by any of the sons of men, they do all come far short of those melting strains of love that are there expressed. So sweet and amiable was the conversation of Jesus Christ, that it is reported of the apostle Peter in the Ecclesiastical History, that after Christ&#39;s ascension he wept so abundantly, that he was always seen wiping his face from the tears; and being asked why he wept so, he answered, He could not choose but weep as often as he thought of that most sweet conversation of Jesus Chiist.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bow. </span></p>

It was suspended on the back part of the thigh, almost to the ground, but was not girded upon it; the horseman&#39;s sword was fixed on the saddle by a girth. When David, in spirit invites the Redeemer of the church to gird his sword upon his thigh, and the spouse says, of the valiant of Israel, &quot;every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night &quot; (Cant. iii. 8), they do not mean that the weapon was literally bound upon their thigh, but hung in the girdle on the back part of it; for this was the mode in which, by the universal testimony of ancient writers, the infantry wore their swords. It is still the practice in the East to wear swords in this manner, for Chardin informs us, that &quot;the Eastern people wear their swords hanging down at length ; and the Turks wear their swords on horseback, and on their thigh.&quot; But in his poetical invitation to the Redeemer, to gird his sword upon his thigh, David manifestly points to some special occasion of solemn and official character: and a clear light is thrown upon his meaning by a custom to this day observed in the East. &quot;When a Persian or an Ottoman prince <span style='font-style:italic;'>ascends </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>throne,&quot; </span>says Mr. Morier, &quot; he girds on his sabre.

The prince went in great state to the temple, where he presented offerings, and then, the sword having been girded on his thigh, the priest presented a pot of sandal- powder, in which the prince, who <span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><i>now </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>called </span>king, dipped his fingers.&quot;</p>

It must be observed, however, that this description of the word of God is applicable to it only when Christ girds it on, and employs it as his sword. Of what use is a sword, even though it be the sword of Goliath, while it lies still in its scabbard, or is grasped by the powerless hand of an infant? In those circumstances it can neither conquer nor defend, however well suited it might be to do both in the hand of a warrior. It is the same with the sword of the Spirit. While it lies still in its scabbard, or is wielded only by the infantile hand of Christ&#39;s ministers, it is a powerless and useless weapon:<a id='GBS.PA365.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.380.1.0.box.172.293.1302.532.q.60'>
11 weapon at which the weakest sinner can laugh, and against which he can defend himself with the utmost ease. But not so when he who is the Most Mighty girds it on. Then it becomes a weapon of tremendous power, a weapon resistless as the bolt of heaven. &quot;Is not my word like a fire, and a hammer, saith the Lord, which breaketh the rock in pieces?&quot; It is indeed, for what can be more efficacious and irresistible than a weapon sharper than a two-edged sword, wielded by the arm of omnipotence? What must his sword be whose glance is lightning? Armed with this weapon, the Captain of our salvation cuts his way to the sinner with infinite ease, though surrounded by rocks and mountains, scatters his strongholds and refuges of lies, and with a mighty blow cleaves asunder his heart of adamant, and lays him prostrate and trembling at his feet. Since such are the effects of this weapon in the hand of Christ, it is with the utmost propriety that the psalmist begins by requesting him <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gird </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on, </span>and not suffer it to be inactive in its scabbard, or powerless in the feeble grasp of his ministers.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Edward </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Payson. </span></span></p>

He saw his all-conquering Prince gird on his resistless sword, array himself in glory and majesty, ascend the chariot of his gospel, display the banner of his cross, and ride forth, as on the wings of the wind, while the tremendous voice of a herald proclaimed before him: &quot;Prepare ye the way of the Lord,&quot; exalt the valleys, and level the hills; make the ciocked ways straight, and the rough places plain ; for, behold, the Lord God comes; he comes, with a strong hand, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

Christ and the saints are in common one with another. Doth the Spirit of holiness dwell in him? So he doth in them too. Is Christ King and Priest? Why, so are they, too, by the grace of union with him. He hath made us kiricrs and priests to God and his Father. This is the saints&#39; dignity, to be Christ&#39;s fellows, consorts, or co-partners; so that look whatever grace or excellency is in Christ, it is not impropriated to himself, but they do share with him; for indeed he was filled with the fulness of the Spirit for their sakes and use. As the sun is filled with light not to shine to itself, but to others, so is Christ with grace; and therefore some translate the text not <span style='font-style:italic;'>pro/ </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>consortibus, </span>above thy fellows, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>propter </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eonsortes, </span>for thy fellows f making Christ the first receptacle of all grace, who first and immediately is filled from the fountain of the Godhead, but it is for his people who receive and derive from him according to their proportion. This is a great truth ; and the dignity of the saints lies chiefly in the partnership with Christ, though our translation, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>above </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fellows,&quot; </span>suits best both with the importance of the word and scope of the place.

But then, whatever <span style='font-style:italic;'>dignity </span>is ascribed herein to the saints, there is, and still must be, a <span style='font-style:italic;'>pre-eminency </span>acknowledged and ascribed to Christ: if they are anointed with the spirit of grace, much more abundantly is Christ: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anointed </span><i>thee </i><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>oil </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gladness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>above </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fellows.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tUivel. </span></p>

All its ingredients were considered sacred. The Israelites were forbidden to pour it upon man&#39;s flesh, or to attempt any imitation of it in their own perfumes. Ivory was in early times, as it still is, rare and costly, and it was highly esteemed as a material for household decoration, on which the finest workmanship and the most princely expenditure were displayed. In palaces of ivory, therefore, it was to be expected that, in correspondence with the magnificence of their structure and the costliness of their furniture, the ointment employed for anointing would be of the richest perfume, and in the greatest profusion. According to our version of the Psalm, the divine Saviour is thus represented as being anointed with oil of the very best kind, even oil taken from the ivory palaces; and also as receiving it in no ordinary measure. His anointing was not confined to a few ceremonial drops poured upon the head, but so abundant is it said to have been, that <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>his garments <span style='font-style:italic;'>smelled </span>of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia.</p>

His garments are supposed not merely to have been all richly perfumed, or even thoroughly saturated with the oil of gladness, but to have consisted of the very articles which entered into the composition of the most precious and odoriferous unguent: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>garments </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>myrrh, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>aloes, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cassia.&#39;&#39; </span>This is figurative language, but nothing could more emphatically exhibit how truly &quot;the Spirit rested on Jesus, and abode with him&quot; in all the plenitude of his heavenly gifts. That heavenly anointing constituted, as it were, his very dress, &quot;excelling&quot; in the quantity or measure of the anointing &quot;the palaces of ivory ;&quot; because their furnitures, however highly scented, were not made of aromatic materials. The strength of the perfumes would evaporate, the fragrance would soon diminish; but permanent as well as plentiful fragrance is secured to him whose &quot;garments are all myrrh, aloes, and cassia.&quot; It is added, in the way<a id='GBS.PA369.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.384.1.0.box.158.296.1296.458.q.60'>
of parallelism, &quot;excelling those which delight in thee,&quot; or those which make thee glad. To say that the persons here alluded to are the occupiers of the ivory palaces, might perhaps be objected to as fanciful ; but palaces are the abodes of kings; and anointed kings, either literally, or typically, or spiritually, are the fellows of the Lord&#39;s Anointed One; and it does seem manifest that, as his anointing causes joy and gladness to all the parties concerned in it, so likewise there is an anointing of those who are honoured to be his fellows which causes joy and gladness to him. The persons who are in the one verse spoken of as giving delight to Christ, there is no reason to regard as any other than the persons spoken of in the former verse as his <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;fellows.&quot; </span>And if this is the case, then we have a comparison drawn betwixt the one and the other in the matter of their anointing, and to that of Christ a decided superiority is ascribed. <span style='font-style:italic;'>David </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Pitcairn, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Anointed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Saviour,&quot; </span>1846.</span></p>

God anointed Christ, when he set him on his everlasting throne, with the oil of gladness; and this anointing was so profuse, his garments were so overspread with it, that they seemed to be nothing but myrrh, aloes, and cassia. The spices, moreover, of which the anointing oil was composed, were the best of their kind, brought, as they were, from the ivory palaces of Minnica.

For the Holy Spirit knoweth that this monster, Monk, sticks fast in our heart&#8212;that we want to be pure and without spot before God. Thus, under Popery, all my temptation was this. I used to say, &#39;that I would willingly go to the sacrament if I were but worthy.&#39; Thus we seek, naturally, a purity in ourselves; and we examine our whole life and want to find a purity in ourselves, that we might have no need of grace, but might be pronounced righteous upon the grounds of our own merit. . . . Thou wilt certainly never become righteous by thyself and thine own works. . . . The Holy Spirit saith, therefore, I will give thee wholesome counsel; and if thou wilt hear me, thou shalt become a virgin all fair. For, if thou wouldst be beautiful in the sight of God, so that all thy works should please him, and he should say, &quot;Thy prayer pleascth me; all that thou sayest, doest, and thinkest, plcaseth me !&quot; proceed thou thus : &quot;hear, see, and incline thine ear;&quot; and thou shalt thus become all fair. When thou hast heard, hast seen, hast forgotten all thine own righteousness, all the law, all traditions, and all that monkery, and hast believed, then art thou fair; not in thine own beauty, but in the beauty of the King who has adorned thee with his Word; because he has brought unto thee thereby his righteousness, his holiness, truth, and fortitude, and all the gifts of the Holy Spirit. . . . The Holy Spirit uses the most exalted language. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>So </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>king </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>greatly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>desire </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>beauty</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>:&quot; </span>that is, thou wilt by this faith prevail upon him to do whatever thou desirest: so that, as one urged by the power of love, he will spontaneously follow thee, abide with thee, and take up his abode with thee. For wherever God has given his Word, there he does not leave his work which he has begun in thee: but he brings upon thee first the temptations of the world, the devil, and the flesh; that by them he may work upon thee. These are his embraces whereby he embraceth his spouse through impatience of love. .... The sum of the whole therefore, is this: That our beauty does not consist in our own virtues, nor even in the gifts which we have received from God, by which we put forth virtues, and do all those things which pertain unto the life of the law; but in this&#8212;our apprehending Christ and believing in him. Then it is that we are truly beautiful: and it is this beauty alone that Christ looks upon, and upon no other. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Sfartin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luther. </span></p>
