Then you think, such an one walks close with God indeed, but I have basely forsaken the Lord, and have had such a haunt of wickedness, I have brought dreadful guilt upon my soul since I saw him last. Ecclesiastical stories tell us of Basil, when the officers came to apprehend him, he being then exercised in holy duties, that there was such a majesty and lustre came from his countenance, that the officers fell down backward (as they did who came to apprehend Christ), they were not able to lay hold of him.

And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.&quot; Here we see that God reigns over the sea immediately, and alters or modifies the arrangements of nature according to his sovereign pleasure. That which Jesus did on one occasion is constantly done by the God of providence. He has not left the ocean to be disturbed at random by the winds, nor to be kept in peace by the laws of nature. He rules the raging of the sea. He raises the waves, and he stilleth them. This exhibits a continually working providence. And what he does in providence he does also in his kingdom of grace.

It is striking that we do not find anywhere in the Old Testament that the patriarchs or prophets called God their Father. You do not find them addressing Him as Father: they did not know him as such. This verse is unintelligible in reference to David ; but in regard to the True David it is exactly what he did say,&#8212;&quot; My Father, and your Father; my God, and your God.&quot; Never until Christ uttered these words, never until he appeared ou earth in humanity as the Son of God, did any man or any child of humanity address God in this endearing character. It was after Christ said, &quot;I ascend unto my Father, and your Father,&quot; that believers were enabled to look up to God and to say, &quot;Abba, Father.&quot; Here you see distinctly that this applies to Christ. He was the first to say this: David did not say it.

Dent. xxi. 17. Secondly, Rule or authority over the younger branches of the family, 2 Chron. xxi. 3; and Thirdly, The exercise of the priesthood, because God claimed all the first-born as his, and in their stead he appointed the Levi tea to do the priest&#39;s office, Numb. viii. 14&#8212;17. But, whilst it is literally true that Jesus was the first-born son of his virgin mother, and on that account entitled to the customary privileges, the promise in the 89th psalm gives intimation of something specific and unusual. David was the youngest son of Jesse, the lowest on the list of a numerous family,&#8212;the very last individual among them who could have expected exaltation over all others. But, notwithstanding these natural disadvantages, he was God&#39;s choice; and by referring to the Scripture history it would be easy to show, in a variety of particulars, how the promise made to David. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>make </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>first-born,&quot; </span>was literally and remarkably fulfilled in the son of Jesse. In like manner Jesse, to all human appearance, entering the world as heir-apparent only to the poveity of Mary and her espoused husband, was far removed from every prospect of realizing that combination of royal and sacerdotal prerogative, which nevertheless was made sure to him by the promise of his heavenly Father: &quot;I will make him <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>first-born.&quot; The pronoun &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>my&quot; </span>gives great emphasis to the promise, but this word is interpolated ; and however truly it conveys an idea of the unspeakable superiority which belongs to Jesus Christ as the result of his relationship with God, still we shall find that, even without this important pronoun, the promise simply of being <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;first-born&quot; </span>has a sublimity and grandeur about it which needs neither ornament nor addition. The great Jehovah, the Maker and the Owner and the Ruler of the universe, hath said respecting his Christ, &quot;I will make him my first-born&quot;; that is, I will constitute him the chief of all creatures, and the depository of all power, and the possessor of all privileges, and the heir of all creation. By way of excellence, <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span>is <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span>first-born, &quot; higher than all the kings of the earth,&quot;&#8212;enjoying priority in point of time, and precedence in point of place.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>David </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Pitcairn, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Anointed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Saviour,&quot; </span>1846.</p>

There is nothiug in our history that God has not met in the covenant with Christ. If you are in union with Christ, and a partaker of the covenant, your case is met in every conceivable emergency. Nothing can befall you which is not contemplated&#8212; nothing which God has not provided for. Even if you fall, God has provided for it ; but take heed; the provision involves much that will be terrible and desperately painful to your mind. There is nothing to encourage sin about it; there is nothing to give us license, nothing to lead a man to boast, &quot;I am safe at last.&quot; Be it so: but safe how? How will God secure their safety? &quot;I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Cupel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Molyncux. </span></span></p>

word. What we bear is the language of passion, not of sedate conviction. This is well expressed by John Howe in a famous sermon. &quot;The expostulation (he observes) was somewhat passionate, and did proceed upon the sudden view of this disconsolate case, very abstractly considered, and by itself only ; and the psalmist did not, at that instant, look beyond it to a better and more comfortable scene of things. An eye bleared with present sorrow sees not far, nor comprehends so much at one view, as it would at another time, or ns it doth presently when the tear is wiped out and its own beams have cleared it up.&quot;</span></p>

I am inclined to go further, and to point to this very complaint as affording a presumption that there was in their hearts an irrepressible sentiment of immortality. The bird that frets and wounds itself on the bars of its cage shews thereby that its proper home is the free air. When inveterate sensuality has succeeded in quenching in a man&#39;s heart the hope of a life beyond the grave, the dreary void which succeeds utters itself, not in solemn complaints like Ethan&#39;s, but in songs of forced mirth&#8212;dismal Anacreontic songs: &quot;Let us eat aud drink for to-morrow we die.&quot;</p>

The summer part is the former; wherein, the church having reaped a most rich crop (the best blessings of heaven and earth) the Psalmist brcaketh forth into the praises of their gracious Benefactor, &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ecer<sup>,</sup>\- </span>so he beginneth, and so he goeth on a great way. Who now would expect anything but mercies, and singing, and summer all the way? Cut summer ceaseth, and wiuter commenced1, at verse 38: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>off </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>abhorred, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>been </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wroth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anointed.&quot;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>Mercies and singing are now turned into troubles and mourning. But nothing shall you hear but bitter qneriinonies and expostulations till you come to the las* verso. There the good man&#39;s come to himself again. Though God were angry with his people, he cannot part with God in discontent. Though God had laden them with crosses, he lifts up his head, and presents God with blessing; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>more. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Amen, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Amen.&quot; </span>He blesseth him as well for winter as for summer, for troubles as for mercies. And thus the last verse of Psalm having as much affinity with the first in matter, as the last day of the year hath with the first in season; if we circle the Psalm, and bring both ends together, we find a fit resemblance between the year and it.</p>

He complaineth in the next precedent verse, of the brevity of his own life (it was like a winter&#39;s day, very short) ; in this, of the instabihty of man&#39;s life; as though he had said, I am not the only mortal. Other men&#39;s lives, though haply clothed with more comforts than mine, are altogether as mortal as mine: for his interrogations are equivalent to strong negations.

Kings as well as subjects, princes as well as the meanest rusties arc liable to this fatal stroke. The lofty cedars and low shrubs; palaces and cottages are alike here. Indeed, we read that Julius Caesar bid the master of the ship wherein he was sailing, take courage notwithstanding the boisterous tempest, because he had Csesar and his fortunes embarked in his vessel, as much as to say, the element on -which they then were could not prove fatal to an emperor, to so great a one as he was. Our William surnamed Rufus said, he never heard of a king that was droivned. And Charles the Fifth, at the Battle of Tunis, being advised to retire when the great ordnance began to play, told them that it was never known that an emperor was slain with great shot, and so rushed into the battle. But this we are sure of. it was never known or heard that any king or crowned head escaped the blow of death at last. The sceptre cannot keep ofi &#39;the arrows that fly by day, and the sickness which wastes at&#39;noon-day it is no screen, no guard against the shafts of death. We have heard of great tyrants and usurpers who vaunted that they had the power of hto and death, and as absolutely disposed<a id='GBS.PA192.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.205.1.0.box.271.271.1296.701.q.60'>
of men as Domitian did of flies; but wo have heard likewise that in a short time (and generally the shorter the more furious they have been) their sceptres are fallen out of their hands; their crowns are toppled off their heads, and they are themselves snatched away by the King of Terrors. Or, if we speak of those royal personages that are mild and gentle, and like Vespasian are the darlings and delight of the people, yet these no less than others have their fatal hour, and their regal honour and majesty are laid in the dust. <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>King </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>doth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>die, </span>may be a Common-law maxim, but it is a falsehood according to the laws of God and Nature, and the established constitution of heaven. For God himself who hath said, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gods,&quot; </span>hath also added, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>die </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>like </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men.&#39;&#39; </span>In the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Escurial </span>the palace of the Kings of Spain, is their <span style='font-style:italic;'>cemetery </span>too; there their royal ashes lie. So in the place where the kings and queens of England are crowned, their predecessors arc entombed: to tell them, as it were, that their crowns exempt them not from the grave, and that there is no greatness and splendour that can guard them from the arrest of death. He regards the rich and wealthy no more than the poor and necessitous: he snatches persons out of their mansion-houses and hereditary seats, as well as out of almshouses and hospitals. His dominion is over masters as well as servants, parents as well as children, superiors as well as inferiors.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Edwards. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Verse </span>48.&#8212;</span></p>
