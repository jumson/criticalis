for it was to him that the word of the Lord came by night. 2 Snm. vii., 4, 5. God condescends to employ his gracious ministers to be the means of communication between himself and his favoured ones,&#8212;even to King David the covenant was revealed by Nathan the prophet; thus the Lord puts honour upon his ministers. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>laid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>help </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>one </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mighty.&#39;&#39; </span>The Lord had made David a mighty man of valour, and now he covenants to make him the helper and defender of the Jewish state. In a far fuller sense the Lord Jesus is essentially and immeasurably mighty, and on him the salvation of his people rests by divine appointment, while his success is secured by divine strength being engaged to be with him. Let us lay our faith where God has laid our help. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exalted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>one </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>chosen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people.&#39;&#39; </span>David was God&#39;s elect, elect out of the people, as one of themselves, and elect to the highest position in the state. In his extraction, election, and exaltation, he was an eminent type of the Lord Jesus, who is the man of the people, the chosen of God, and the king of his church. Whom God exalts let us exalt. Woe unto those who despise him, they are guilty of contempt of court before the Lord of Hosts, as well as of rejecting the Son of God.</span></p>

The verse must also be expounded of the Prince Emanuel ; he became the servant of the Lord for our sakes, the Father having found for us in his person a mighty deliveier, therefoie upon him rested the Spirit without measure, to qualify him for all the cftices of love to which he was set apart. We have not a Saviour filf-appointed and unqualified, but one sent of God and divinely endowed for his work. Our Saviour Jesus is also the Lord&#39;s Christ, or anointed. The oil with which he is anointed is God&#39;s own oil, and holy oil; he is divinely endowed with the Spirit of holiness.</p>

This covenant promise ought to be urged in prayer before the Lord, for the great latk of the church at this time is power. We have everything except the divine energy, and we must never rest content until we see it in full operation among us. Jesus must be among us, and then there will be no lack of force in any of our church agencies.</p>

David had in his earlier history been hunted by Saul like a partridge on the mountains, and though he had striven in all things to act justly towards Saul, because he was the Lord&#39;s anointed, yet Saul was never content with his displays of loyalty, but persecuted him relentlessly. The covenant, therefore, engaged that his hfe of hardship and oppression should come to an end for ever; it did so in David&#39;s own person, and more remarkably still in the life of Solomon his son. Who does not in all this see a type of the Lord Jesus, who though he was once seized for our debts, and also evil entreated by the ungodly, is now so exalted that he can never be exacted upon any more, neither can the fiercest of his enemies vex him again. No Judas can now betray him to death, no Pilate can deliver him to be crucified. Satan cannot tempt him, and our sins cannot burden him.</p>

To David and his seed, God was gracious and faithful, and though through their sin the literal kingdom lost all its glory and the dynasty became obscure, yet the line remained unbroken and more than all its former glory was restored by the enthronisation of Him who is Prince of the kings of the earth, with whom the Lord&#39;s mercy and faithfulness remain for ever. All who are in Jesus should rejoice, for they shall prove in their own experience the faithful mercy of the Lord. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>horn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ix&gt; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exalted.&#39;&#39; </span>Gloriously does the Lord Jesus lift up his head, raised to the highest place of honour by the mandate of the Father.

In this filial crying the true sons should iiuitate him. This is the common language of the elect family: adoption, reverence, trust, must all speak in their turns, and will do if we are heirs according to promise. To say to God &quot; Thou art my father&quot; is more than learning and talent can teach us; the new birth is essential to this.

Some commentators talk of conditions, but we fail to see any; the promises are as absolute as they can possibly be, and if any conditions as to the conduct of the favoured individuals can be conceived, they are disposed of in the succeeding verses.</p>

So, too, the seed of the Son of David are apt to start aside, but are they therefore cast away? Not a single word gives liberty for such an idea, but the very reverse. Expositors in their fear of Calvinistic doctrine shake off the fear of adding to the word of God, or else they would not have spent their time in talking about &quot;the conditions&quot; of this absolutely unconditional covenant.</p>

If their sin be negative or positive, if it be forsaking or profanation; if either judgments or commandments or both be violated, yet there is not a word as to final destruction, but the very reverse. Legalism will import its ifs, but the Lord slays the ifs as fast as they rise. Eternal shalls and wills make glorious havoc among the ifs and buts.</p>

God never plays with his rod, he lays it well home to his children, he <span style='font-style:italic;'>risits </span>them with it in their houses, bodies, and hearts, and makes them know that he is grieved with their ways. He smites home and chastens <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stripes,&quot; </span>which are either many or few in proportion as the heart is properly affected by them.

trying circumstances the Lord&#39;s lovingkindness to each one of his chosen will endure the stiain. If the covenant could be marie void by our sins it would have been void long ere this; and if renewed its tenure would not be worth an hour&#39;s purchase if it had remained dependent upon us. God may leave his people, and they may thereby suffer much and fall very low, but utterly and altogether he never can remove his love from them; for that would be to cast a reflection upon his own truth, and this he will never allow, for he adds, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>nor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>suffer </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faithfulness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fail.&quot; </span>Man fails in all points, but God in none. To be faithful is one of the eternal characteristies of God, in which he always places a great part of his glory: his truth is one of his peculiar treasures aud crown jewels, and he will never endure that it should be tarnished in any degree. This passage sweetly assures us that the heirs of glory shall not be utterly cast off. Let those deny the safety of the saints who choose to do so, we have not so learned Christ. We believe in the gospel rod, but not in the penal sword for the adopted sons.</span></p>

A word once given is sacred; ouce let a promise pass our lips and honesty forbids that we should recall it,&#8212;unless indeed the tiiing promised be impossible, or wicked, neither of which can happen with the promises of God. How consoling it is to see the Lord thus resolute. He, in the words before us, virtually reasserts his covenant and rehearses his engagements. This he does at such length, and with such reiteration, that it is evident he takes pleasure in that most ancient and solemn contract. If it were conceivable that he had repented of it, he would not be found dwelling upon it, and repeating it with renewed emphasis.</p>

He does as good as say that if he ceases to be true to his covenant he will have forfeited his holy character. What more can he say? In what stronger language can he express his unalterable adherence to the truth of his promise? An oath is the end of all strife ; it ought to be the end of all doubt on our part. We cannot imagine that God could lie, yet he puts it so&#8212;that if the covenant were not kept by him, he would regard it as a lie. Here is ground for strong confidence; may our faith be of such a nature as these assurances will warrant.</p>

He was a theocratic monarch, and the Lord, who gave him his crown, took it from him and treated it with contempt,&#8212;at least so it seemed. .In these sad days also we may utter the same plaint, for Jesus is not acknowledged in many of the churches, and usurpers have profaned his crown. When we hear of kings and queens set up as &quot; heads of the church,&quot; and a priest styled &quot; The Vicar of Christ,&quot; while parliaments and courts take upon themselves to legislate for the church of God, we may bitterly lament that things should come to so wretched a pass. Few are there who will acknowledge the crown rights of King Jesus, the very subject is considered to be out of date. O Lord how long!</p>

The &quot; divinity which doth hedge a king&quot; had departed. Hitherto, the royal family had been like a vine within an enclosure, but the wall was now laid low, and the vine was unprotected. It is sorrowfully true that in many places the enclosures of the church have been destroyed, the line of demarcation between the church and the world has almost vanished, and godless men fill the sacred offices. Alas, O Lord God, shall it be always so? Shall thy true vine be deserted by thee, thou great Husbandman?

Thus has it happened that precious truths, which were the bulwarks of the church, have been assailed by heresy, and the citadels of sound doctrine have been abandoned to the foe. O God, how canst thou suffer this? As the God of truth, wilt thou not arise and tread down falsehood?</p>

Woe is the day when every petty reosoner has an argument against religion, and men in their cups are fluent with objections against the gospel of Jesus. Although Jesus on the cross is nothing to them, and they pass him by without inquiring into what he has done for them, yet they can loiter as long as you will, if there be but the hope of driving another nail into his hands and helping to crucify the Lord afresh. They will not touch him with the finger of faith, but they pluck at him with the hand of malice. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reproach </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>neigltbours.&quot; </span>David&#39;s successors had unneighbourly neighbours, who were a reproach to good fellowship, because they were so ready to reproach their neighbour. The Jews were much taunted by the surrounding Gentiles when at any time they fell into trouble. At this time the people of God, who follow the Lord fully, are subject to a thousand reproaches, and some of them of the most bitter kind. These reproaches are really the reproach of Christ, and, at bottom, are meant for him. Shall it always be so? Shall he, who deserves to be universally adored, be subject to general scorn? Where, then, O God, is thy faithfulness to thy covenant?</p>

This has happened even to naturally brave men&#8212;a terrible dread has unmanned them. At this present the church has few swords of true Jerusalem metal; her sons are pliable, her ministers yield to pressure. We need men whose edge cannot be turned, firm for truth, keen against error, sharp towards sin, cutting their way into men&#39;s hearts. Courage and decision are more needed now than ever, for charity towards heresy is the fashionable vice, and indifference to all truth, under the name of liberal-mindedness, is the crowning virtue of the age. The Lord send us men of the school of Elias, or. at least, of Luther and Knox.</p>

You may see this to have been the way of writing in use, as what was to last for ever: as Job xix. 23, 24. -&#39; Oh, that my words were now written ! oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!&quot; And what is that rock or marble here?

This also is there specified as having been taken by God: &quot;Once have I sworn by my holiness,&quot; etc., and sworn by him that cannot lie, and sworn to that end, &quot;to show the immutability of his counsel,&quot; Heb. vi. 17.

Therefore, the ptomise imports that Christ shall reign, not simply as a person in the Godhead (which he ever did, ever will, and ever must) ; but relatively, mediatorially, and in his office-character, as the deliverer and king of Zion. Hence it follows, that his people cannot be lost : for he would be a poor sort of a king who had or might nave no subjects to reign over.
