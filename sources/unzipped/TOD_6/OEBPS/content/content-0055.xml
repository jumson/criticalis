To the saints the Lord Jehovah, the self-existent God, stands instead of mansion and rooftree; he shelters, comforts, protects, preserves, and cherishes all his own. Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the saints dwell in their God, and have always done so in all ages. Not in the tabernacle or the temple do we dwell, but in God himself; and this we have always done since there was a church in the world. We have not shifted our abode. Kings&#39; palaces have vanished beneath the crumbling hand of time&#8212;they have been burned with fire and buried beneath mountains of ruins, but the imperial race of heaven has never lost its regal habitation. Go to the Palatine and see how the Caesars are forgotten of the halls which echoed to their despotic mandates, and resounded with the plaudits of the nations over which they ruled, and then look upward and see in the ever-living Jehovah the diviue home of the faithful, untouched by so much as the finger of decay. Where dwelt our fathers a hundred generations since, there dwell we still. It is of New Testament saints that the Holy Ghost has said, &quot;He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in God and God in him!&quot; It was a divine mouth which said, &quot;Abide in me,&quot; and then added, &quot;he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit.&quot; It is most sweet to speak with the Lord as Moses did, saying, &quot;Lord, thou art our dwelling-place,&quot; and it is wise to draw from the Lord&#39;s eternal condescensions reasons for expecting present and future mercies, as the psalmist did in the next psalm wherein he describes the safety of those who dwell in God.</p>

How much may be crowded into it,&#8212;the rise and fall of empires, the glory and obliteration of dynasties, the beginning and the end of elaborate systems of human philosophy, and countless events, all important to household and individual, which elude the pens of historians. Yet this period, which might even be called the limit of modern history, and is in human language almost identical with an indefinite length of time, is to the Lord as nothing, even as time already gone. A moment yet to come is longer than &quot;yesterday when it is past,&quot; for that no longer exists at all, yet such is a chiliad to the Eternal.

A host of days and nights must be combined to make up a thousand years to us, but to God, that space of time does not make up a whole night, but only a brief portion of it. If a thousand years bo to God as a single night-watch, what must be the life-time of the Eternal!</p>

It must have been a very mournful sight to Moses to sec the whole nation melt away during the forty years of their pilgrimage, till none remained of all that came out of Egypt.

immortality and life are brought to light by the gospel, death has changed its aspect, and, to believers in Jesus, it is no more a judicial execution. Anger and wrath are the sting of death, and in these believers have no share; love and mercy now conduct us to glory by the way of the tomb. It is not seemly to read these words at a Christian&#39;s funeral without words of explanation, and a distinct endeavour to shew how little they belong to believers iu Jesus, and how far we are privileged beyond those with whom he was not well pleased. &quot;whose carcasses fell in the wilderness.&quot; To apply an ode, written by the leader of the legal dispensation under circumstances of peculiar judgment, in reference to a people under penal censure, to those who fall asleep in Jesus, seems to be the height of blundering. We may learn much from it, but we ought not to misapply it by taking to ourselves, as the beloved of the Lord, that which was chiefly true of those to whom God had sworn in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest. When, however, a soul is under conviction of sin, the language of this Psalm is highly appropriate to his case, and will naturally suggest itself to the disttacted mind. No fire consumes like God&#39;s anger, and no anguish so troubles the heart as his wrath. Blessed be that dear substitute,</span></p>

There can be no more powerful luminary than the face of God, yet, in that strong light, the Lord set the hidden sins of Israel. Sunlight can never be compared with the light of him who made the sun, of whom it is written, &quot;God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&quot; If by his countenance is here meant his love and favour, it is not possible for the heinousness of sin to be more clearly manifested than when it is seen to involve ingratitude to one so infinitely good and kind. Rebellion in the light of justice is black, but in the light of love it is devilish. How can we grieve so good a God? The children of Israel had been brought out of Egypt with a high hand, fed in the wilderness with a liberal hand, and guided with a tender hand, and their sins were peculiarly atrocious. We, too, having been redeemed by the blood of Jesus, and faved by abounding grace, will be verily guilty if we forsake the Lord. What manner of persons ought we to be?

This is brevity itself compared with the men of the elder time; it is nothing when contrasted with eternity. Yet is life long enough for virtue and piety, and all too long for vice and blasphemy. Moses here in the original writes in a disconnected manner, as if he would set forth the utter insignificance of man&#39;s hurried existence. His words may be rendered, &quot;The days of our years! In them seventy years:&quot; as much as to say, &quot;The days of our years? What about them? Are they worth mentioning?

What a crushing sense of weakness! The evil days are come and the years wherein a man cries, &#39;- I have no pleasure in them.&quot; The grasshopper has become a burden and desire faileth. Such is old age. Yet mellowed by hallowed experience, and solaced by immortal hopes, the latter days of aged Christians are not so much to be pitied as envied. The sun is setting and the heat of the day is over, but sweet is the calm and cool of the eventide; and the fair day melts away, not into a dark and dreary night, but into a glorious, unclouded, eternal day.

His words are more nearly rendered. &quot;He drives us fast and we fly away;&quot; as the quails were blown along by the strong west wind, so are men hurried before the tempests of death.

it is never too much moved ; apart from other considerations the great truth of the divine anger, when most powerfully felt, never impresses the mind with a solemnity in excess of the legitimate result of such a contemplation. What the power of God&#39;s anger is in hell, and what it would be on earth, were it not in mercy restrained, no man living can rightly conceive. Modern thinkers rail at Milton and Dante, Bunyan and Baxter, for their teriible imagery; but the truth is that no vision of poet, or denunciation of holy seer, can ever reach to the dread height of this great argument, much less go beyond it. The wrath to come has its horrors rather diminished than enhanced in description by the dark lines of human fancy; it baffles words, it leaves imagination far behind. Beware ye that forget God lest he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver. God is terrible out of his holy places. Remember Sodom and Gomorrah! Remember Korah and his company! Mark well the graves of lust in the wilderness! Nay, rather bethink ye of the place where their worm dieth not, and their fire is noi quenched. Who is able to stand against this justly angry God? Who will dare to rush upon the bosses of his buckler, or tempt the edge of his sword? Be it ours to submit ourselves as dying sinners to this eternal God, who can, even at this moment, command us to the dust, and thence to</span></p>

Numeration is a child&#39;s exercise in arithmetic, but in order to number their days aright the best of men need the Lord&#39;s teaching.

Thus Moses prayed that the dispensations of justice might be sanctified in mercy. &quot;The law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,&quot; when the Lord himself speaks by the law. It is most meet that the heart which will so soon cease to beat should while it moves be regulated by wisdom&#39;s hand. A short life should be wisely spent. We have not enough time at our disposal to justify us in misspending a single quarter of an hour. Neither are we sure of enough life to justify us in procrastinating for a moment.

Do not leave us to perish. Suffer not our lives to be both brief and bitter. Thou hast said to us, &#39;&#39;Return, ye children of men,&quot; and now we humbly cry to thee, &quot;Return, thou preserver of men.&quot; Thy presence alone can reconcile us to this transient existence; turn thou unto us. As sin drives God from us, so repentance cries to the Lord to return to us. When men are under chastisement they are allowed to expostulate, and ask &quot;how long?&quot; Our faith in these times is not too great boldness with God, but too much backwardness in pleading with him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>repent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>concerning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servants.&quot; </span>Thus Moses acknowledges the Israelites to be God&#39;s servants still. They had rebelled, but they had not utterly forsaken the Lord ; they owned their obligations to obey his will, and pleaded them as a reason for pity. Will not a man spare his own servants? Though God smote Israel, yet they were his people, and he had never disowned them, therefore is he entreated to deal favourably with them. If they might not see&#39;the promised land, yet he is begged to cheer them on the road with his mercy, and to turn his frown into a smile. The prayer is like others which came from the meek lawgiver when he boldly pleaded with God for the nation; it is Mcses-like. He here speaks with the Lord as a man spcaketh with his friend.</p>

Good men know how to turn the darkest trials into arguments at the throne of grace. He who has but the heart to pray need never be without pleas in prayer. The only satisfying food for the Lord&#39;s people is the favour of God ; this Moses earnestly seeks for, and as the manna fell in the morning he beseeches the Lord to send at once his satisfying favour, that all through the little day of life they might be filled therewith. Are we so soon to die? Then, Lord, do not starve us while we live. Satisfy us at once, we pray thee. Our day is short and the night hastens on, O give us in the early morning of our days to be satisfied with thy favour, that all through our little day we may be happy. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoice </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glad </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>days.&quot; </span>Being filled with divine love, their brief life on earth would become a joyful festival, and would continue so as long as it lasted. When the Lord refreshes us with his presence, our joy is such that no man can take it from us. Apprehensions of speedy death are not able to distress those who enjoy the present favour of God; though they know that the night cometh they see nothing to fear in it, but continue to live while they live, triumphing in the present favour of God and leaving the future in his loving hands. Since the whole generation which came out of Egypt had been doomed to die in the wilderness, they would naturally feel despondent, and therefore their great leader seeks for them that blessing which, beyond all others, consoles the heart, namely, the presence and favour of the Lord.</p>

Fill the other scale. Proportion thy dispensations. Give us the lamb, since thou has sent us the bitter herbs. Make our days as long as our nights. The prayer is original, childlike, and full of meaning; it is moreover based upon a great principle in providential goodness, by which the Lord puts the good over against the evil in due measure. Great trial enables us to bear great joy, and may be regarded as the herald of extraordinary grace. God&#39;s dealings are according to scale; small lives are small throughout; and great histories are great both in sorrow and happiness. Where there are high hills there are also deep valleys. As God provides the sea for leviathan, so does he find a pool for the minnow ; in the sea all things are in fit proportion for the mighty monster, while in the little brook all things befit the tiny fish. If we have fierce afflictions we may look for overflowing delights, and our faith may boldly ask for them.

Their sons were to inherit the land which had been given them by covenant, and therefore they sought on their behalf some tokens of the coming good, some morning dawnings of the approaching noonday. How eagerly do good men plead for their children. They can bear very much personal affliction if they may but be sure that their children will know the glory of God, and thereby be led to serve him. We are content with the work if our children may but see the glory which will result from it: we sow joyfully if they may reap.</p>

Good men are anxious not to work in vain. They know that without the Lord they can do nothing, and therefore they cry to him for help in the work, for acceptance of their efforts, and for the establishment of their designs. The church as a whole earnestly desires that the hand of the Lord may so work with the hand of his people, that a substantial, yea, an eternal edifice to the praise and glory of God may be the result. We come and go. but the Lord&#39;s work abides. We are content to die so long as Jesus lives and his kingdom grows. Since the Lord abides for ever the same, we trust our work in his hands, and feel that since it is far more his work than ours he will secure it immortality. When we have withered like grass our holy service, like gold, silver, and precious stones, will survive the fire.</p>

Yes; and to him who was the refuge of a Moses and an Abraham, I too in the day of trouble can lift my hands.&#39; Delightful thought!

From the remotest period his name has been attached to it, and almost every Biblical scholar, from Jerome down to Ilengstenberg, has agreed to accept it as a prayer of that &quot; man of God &quot; whose name it has always carried. If so, it is one of the oldest poems in the world. Compared with it Homer and Pindar are (so to speak) modern, and even King David is of recent date. That is to say, compared with this ancient hymn the other Psalms are as much more moder n as Tennyson and Longfellow arc more modern than Chaucer. In either case there arc nearly five centuries between.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hamilton. </span></p>

True is it in its report of human life&#8212;as troubled, transitory, and sinful. True in its conception of the Eternal&#8212;the Sovereign and the Judge; and yet the refuge and hope of men, who, notwithstanding the most severe trials of their faith, lose not their confidence in him; but who, in the firmness of faith, pray for, as if they were predicting, a near-at-hand season of refreshment. Wrapped, one might say, in mystery, until the distant day of revelation should come, there is here conveyed the doctrine of Immortality; for in the very plaint of the brevity of the life of man, and of the sadness of these, his few years of trouble, and their brevity, and their gloom, there is brought into contrast the Divine immutability ; and yet it is in terms of a submissive piety: the thought of a life eternal is here in embryo. No taint is there in this Psalm of the pride and petulance&#8212;the halfuttered blasphemy&#8212;the malign disputing or arraignment of the justice or goodness of God, which have so often shed a venomous colour upon the language of those who have writhed in anguish, personal or relative. There are few probably among those who have passed through times of bitter and distracting woe, or who have stood&#8212;the helpless spectators of the miseries of others, that have not fallen into moods of mind violently in contrast with the devout and hopeful melancholy which breathes throughout this ode.

to the Hebrew Lawgiver or not, it bespeaks its remote antiquity, not merely by the majestic simplicity of its style, but negatively, by the entire avoidance of those sophisticated turns of thought which belong to a late&#8212;a lost age in a people&#39;s intellectual and moral history. This Psalm, undoubtedly, is centuries older than the moralizings of that time when the Jewish mind had listened to what it could never bring into a true assimilation with its own mind&#8212;the abstractions of the Greek Philosophy.</span></p>

Since he calls God, who is eternal, our habitation, or to speak more clearly, our place of refuge, to whom fleeing we may be in safety. For if God is our dwelling-place, and God is life, and we dwellers in him, it necessarily follows, that we are in life, and shall live for ever. . . . For who will call God the dwelling-place of the dead? Who shall regard him as a sepulchre? He is life; and therefore they also live to whom he is a dwelling-place. After this fashion Moses, in the very introduction, before he lets loose his horrible thunderings and lightnings, fortifies the trembling, that they may firmly hold God to be the living dwelling-place of the living, of those that pray to him, and put their trust in him.</p>

For the Hebrew word J1P\? properly signifies a dwelling-place, as when the Scripture says, &quot;In Zion is his dwelling-place,&quot; where this word (Maon) is used. But because a house is for the purpose of safety, it results, that this word has the meaning of a refuge or place of refuge. But Moses wishes to speak with such great care that he may shew that all our hopes have been placed most securely in God, and that they who are about to pray to this God may be assured that<a id='GBS.PA208.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.221.1.0.box.273.275.1298.603.q.60'>
they arc not afflicted in this work in vain, nor die, since they have God as a place of refuge, and the divine Majesty as a dwelling-place, in which they may rest secure for ever. Almost in the same strain Paul speaks, when he says to the Colossians, &quot;Your life is hid with Christ in God.&quot; For it is a much clearer and moie luminous expression to say, Believers dwell in God, than that God dwells in them. He dwelt also visibly in Zion, but the place is changed. But because he (the believer, is in God, it is manifest, that he cannot be moved nor transferred, for God is a habitation of a kind that cannot perish. Moses therefore wished to exhibit the most certain life, when he said, God is our dwelling-place, not the earth, not heaven, not paradise, but simply God himself. If after this manner you take this Psalm it will become sweet, and seem in all respects most useful. When a monk, it often happened to me when I read this Psalm, that I was compelled to lay the book out of my hand. But I knew not that these terrors were not addressed to an awakened mind. I knew not that Moses was speaking to a most obdurate and proud multitude, which neither understood nor cared for the anger of God, nor were humbled by their calamities, or even in prospect of death.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Martin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luther. </span></span></p>

For the use of such houses was wont to be not only to defend men from the injury of the weather, and to keep safely, within the walls and under the roof all other things necessary for this hfe, and to be a place of abode, wherein men might the more commodiously provide for all other things necessary, and walk in some calling profitable to their neighbour and to the glory of God; but also to protect them from the violence of brute beasts and rage of enemies. Now the prophet herein seems to note a special and more immediate providence of God ; (for of all kind of people they seemed to be most forsaken and forlorn) ; that whereas the rest of the world seemed to have their habitations and mansions rooted in the earth, and so to dwell upon the earth ; to live in cities and walled towns in all wealth and state; God&#39;s people were as it were without house and home. Abraham was called out of his own country, from his father&#39;s house, where no doubt he had goodly buildings, and large revenues, and was commanded by God to live as a foreigner in a strange country, amongst savage people, that he knew not; and to abide in tents, booths, and cabins, having little hope to live a settled and comfortable life in any place. In like manner lived his posterity, Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve patriarchs, wandering from place to place in the land of Canaan; from thence translated into the land of Egypt, there living at courtesy, and as it were tenants at will, and in such slavery and bondage, that it had been better for them to have been without house and home. After this for forty years together (at which time this Psalm was penned) they wandered up and down in a desolate wilderness, removing from place to place, and wandering, as it were in a maze. So that of all the people of the earth, God&#39;s own people had hitherto lived as pilgrims and banished persons, without house or home; and therefore the prophet here professeth that God himself more immediately by his extraordinary providence, for many ages together had protected them, and been as it were a mansion house unto them; that is, the more they were deprived of these ordinary comforts of this life, the more was God present with them, supplying by his extraordinary and immediate providence what they wanted in regard of ordinary means. The due consideration of this point may minister matter of great joy and comfort to such children of God as aro thoroughly humbled with the consideration of man&#39;s mortality in general, or of theirs whom they rely and depend upon iu special.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bradshaw, </span>1621.</p>
