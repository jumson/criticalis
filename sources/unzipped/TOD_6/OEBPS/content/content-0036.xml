He wills that the church shall be, he settles all arrangements for her calling, salvation, maintenance and perfection, and all his attributes, like the mountains round about Jerusalem, lend their strength for her support. Not on the sand of carnal policy, nor in the morass of human kingdoms, has the Lord founded his church, but on his own power and godhead, which are pledged for the establishment of his beloved church, which is to him the chief of all his works. What a theme for meditation is the founding of the church of God in the ancient covenant engagements of eternity; the abrupt character of this first verse indicates long consideration on the part of the writer, leading up to his bursting forth in wonder and adoration. Well might such a theme cause his heart to glow. Rome stands on her seven hills and has never lacked a poet&#39;s tongue to sing her glories, but more glorious far art thou, O Ziona, among the eternal mountains of God : while pen can write or mouth can speak, thy praises shall never lie buried in inglorious silence.</p>

The love of God is greatest to his own elect nation, descended from his servant Jacob, yet the central seat of his worship is &#39;dearer still; no other supposable comparison could have so fully displayed the favour which Jehovah bore to Jerusalem,&#8212;he loves Jacob best and Zion better than the best. At this hour the mystical teaching of these words is plain. God delights in the prayers and praises of Christian families and individuals, but he has a special eye to the assemblies of the faithful, and he has a special delight in their devotions in their church capacity. The great festivals, when the crowds surrounded the temple gates, were fair in the Lord&#39;s eyes, and even such is the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven. This should lead each separate believer to identify himself with the church of God ; where the Lord reveals his love the most, there should each believer most delight to be found. Our own dwellings are very dear to us, but we must not prefer them to the assemblies of the saints; we must say of the church&#8212;</p>

Glorious things were taught in the streets, and seen in her temples. Glorious things were foretold of her, and she was the type of the most glorious things of all. This is yet more true of the church : she is founded in grace, but her pinnacles glow with glory. Men may glory in her without being braggarts, she has a lustre about her brow which none can rival. Whatever glorious things the saints may say of the church in their eulogies, they cannot exceed what prophets have foretold, what angels have sung, or what God himself has declared. Happy are the tongues which learn to occupy themselves with so excellent a subject, may they be found around our fire-sides, in our market-places, and in all the spots where men most congregate. Never let thy praises cease, O thou bride of Christ, thou fairest among women, thou in whom the Lord himself hath placed his delight, calling thee by that pearl of names, Hephzibah,&#8212;&quot; for my delight is in her.&quot; Since the Lord has chosen thee, and deigns to dwell in thee, O thou city of beauty, none can rival thee, thou art the eye of the world, the pearl, the queen of all the cities of the universe ; the true &quot; eternal city,&quot; the metropolitan, the mother of us all. The years to come shall unveil thy beauties to the astonished eyes of all peoples, and the day of thy splendour shall come to its sevenfold noon.</p>

What a patent of nobility is it, for a man to have it certified that he was born in Zion ; the twice born are a royal priesthood, the true aristocracy, the imperial race of men. The original, by using the noblest word for man, intimates that many remarkable men will be born in the church, and indeed every man who is renewed in the image of Christ is an eminent personage, while there are some, who, even to the dim eyes of the world, shine forth with a lustre of character which cannot but be admitted to be unusual and admirable. The church has illustrious names of prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, reformers, missionaries and the like, which bear comparison with the grandest names honoured by the world, nay, in many respects far excel them. Zion has no reason to be ashamed of her sons, nor her sons of her. &quot;Wisdom is justified of her children.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>highest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>himself </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>establish </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>her&quot;</span>&#8212;the only establishment worth having. When the numbers of the faithful are increased by the new birth, the Lord proves himself to be the upbuilder of the church. The Lord alone deserves to wear the title of Defender of the Faith; he is the sole and sufficient Patron and Protector of the true church. There is no fear for the Lord&#39;s heritage, his own arm is sufficient to maintain his rights. The Highest is higher than all those who are against us, and the good old cause shall triumph over all.</p>

Its elevation is remarkable, occasioned, not from its being on the summit of one of the numerous hills of Judsea, like most of the towns and villages, but because it is on the edge of one of the highest table-lands of the country. Hebron, indeed, is higher still, by some hundred feet; and from the south, accordingly, the approach to Jerusalem is by a slight descent. But from every other side, the ascent is peipetual; and, to the traveller approaching Jerusalem from the west or east, it must always have presented the appearance, beyond any other capital of the then known world&#8212;we may add, beyond any important city that has ever existed on the earth&#8212;of a mountain city; breathing, as compared with the sultry plains of the Jordan or of the coast, a mountain air; enthroned, as compared with Jericho or Damascus, Gaza or Tyre, on a mountain fastness. In this respect it concentrated in itself the character of the whole country of which it was to be the capital&#8212;the &quot;mountain throne,&quot; the &quot;mountain sanctuary,&quot; of God. &quot;The &#39; mount&#39; of God is as the &#39;mount&#39; of Bashan ; an high mount as the mount of Bashan. Why leap ye so, ye high &#39;mountains&#39;? this is the &#39;mountain &#39; which God desireth to dwell in &quot;. . . . It was emphatically the lair of the lion of Judah, of &quot;Ariel,&quot; the Linn of God. &quot;In Judah is God known; his name is great in Israel. In Salem is his &#39;leafy covert,&#39; and his &#39;rocky den&#39; in Zion. . . . Thou art more glorious and excellent than the &#39;mountains of the robbers&#39;&quot;. And this wild and fastness-like character of Jerusalem was concentrated yet again in the fortress, the &quot;stronghold&quot; of Zion. That point, the highest in the city, the height which most readily catches the eye from every quarter, is emphatically the &quot; hill fort,&quot; the &quot; rocky hold &quot; of Jerusalem&#8212;the refuge where first the Jebusite, and then the Lion of God, stood at bay against the hunters.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Arthur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Penrhyn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stanley. </span></p>

These are succeeded by the name <span style='font-style:italic;'>Christian, </span>for the Christian Church is now become the true Israel of God. He loves his saints on account of that image of himself which they bear; he loves them on account of those graces which are infused into them when they are renewed by the Spirit; he loves them on account of the relation they stand in to him as his people, and as his churoh, who are qualified for the duties of the relation by that love of their Father, that reliance upon his care, that delight in his person, that enjoyment in his service, which belongs to dutiful and affectionate children. He loves them because they imitate his perfections in some humble measure&#8212; because they receive the word of his mouth&#8212;because they are ready to obey every call of his providence, setting themselves in the paths of his testimony wherever he may direct&#8212;because they yield themselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and their bodies as instruments of righteousness, no longer walking after the deeds of the flesh, but after the will of God. He takes a delight in them; the Lord delighteth in the righteous; he knoweth their way; he loves, approves, and confirms them. The most common occupations of life&#8212;the honest industry of the servants of God, is looked upon by him with approbation. By these they show forth their Father, and the praises of him who called them from darkness to light. The most ordinary duties of our calling become sacrifices to God, and religious duties, when performed in the Spirit, and directed to the great end of glorifying God. He looks with peculiar complacency on the dwellings of his people on account of those domestic devotional acknowledgments of his majesty which are there maintained, when the head walks before his family as a priest to offer praise and thanksgiving; this attracts peculiar approbation and delight. He loves to see his people training up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and their children walking after them in the paths of that obedience which he has enjoined. He delights to see the course of purity which runs iu Christian families. He loves to see the progress which the younger parts of religious families make in piety, while<a id='GBS.PA120.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.133.1.0.box.271.267.1293.311.q.60'>
they grow in grace, and in favour with God and man. He looks down with peculiar delight on such circles as these: there he deigns his presence, and bestows peculiar blessings. However obscure the dwellings of Jacob may be, to him they are open and manifest at all times; and whether in cottages or in palaces, his eye rests there with complacency; and he says of such places, &quot;Here will I dwell for ever and ever.&quot; Prayer and devotion sanctify every family, and diffuse a spirit of piety through all the avocations of life, so that wo need not retire from the world, but are rather called to show forth the virtues of the Christian life in it.</span></p>

Even the worst enemies of their race, the tyrants and oppressors of the Jews, Egypt and Babylon, ate threatened with no curse, no shout of joy is raised at the prospect of their overthrow, but the privileges of citizenship are extended to them, and they are welcomed as brothers. Nay more, God himself receives each one as a child newly-born into his family, acknowledges each as his son, and enrols him with his own hand on the sacred register of his children. It is the mode of anticipating a future union and brotherhood of all the nations of the earth, not by conquest, but by incorporation into one state, and by a birthright so acquired, which is so remarkable. In some of the prophets, more especially in Isaiah, we observe the same liberal, conciliatory, comprehensive language towards foreign states, as Tyre and Ethiopia, and still more strikingly toward Egypt and Assyria (chap. xix. 22&#8212;25). But the psalm stands alone amongst the writings of the Old Testament, in representing this union of nations as a new birth unto the city of God .... It is the first announcement of that great amity of nations, or rather of that universal common citizenship of which heathen philosophers dreamt, which was &quot;in the mind of Socrates when he called himself a citizen of the world,&quot; which had become a common-place of Stoic philosophy, which Judaism tried finally to realize by the admission of proselytes, through baptism, into the Jewish community ; which Bome accomplished, so far as the external semblance went, first by subduing the nations, and then by admitting them to the rights of Boman citizenship. But the true fulfilment of this hope is to be found only in that kingdom which Christ has set up. He has gathered into his commonwealth all the kingdoms of the earth. He has made men one, members of the same family, by teaching them to feel that they are all children of the same Father. He has made it evident that the hope of the Jewish singer is no false hope; that there is a Father in heaven who cares for all, whatever name they bear. Thus the psalm has received a better and higher fulfilment than that which lies on the surface of its words. It was fulfilled in Christ.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stewart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Perowne. </span></p>

A halo and a glory attach, in a case like this, to great antiquity. Now it is long since the city was built. It was standing in the days of Paul. &quot;Ye are come unto the city of the living God.&quot; Heb. xii. 22. David was well acquainted with it. Ps. xlvi. 4. It was standing before tho flood. Noah, Enoch, Abel, dwelt in it. It is almost as old as the creation. II. There are glorious things to tell of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>defences </span>of the city. It has been besieged ever since it was a city at all, and it is not taken to this hour. &quot;We have a strong city,&quot; etc. III.

Jerusalem (the most celebrated of cities, from which this figure is obviously drawn) was built upon the brow of a hill, an extremely conspicuous and beautiful object. IV. In a city there are various buildings, and structures of various shapes, materials and value: illustrate by the different denominations, &amp;c. V. A city has municipal laws. VI.
