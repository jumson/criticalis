Surely their hearts and tongues never cease from magnifying the Lord. We fear David here drew rather a picture of what should be than of what is; for those occupied daily with the offices needful for public worship are not always among the most devout; on the contrary, &quot; the nearer the church the further from God.&quot; Yet in a spiritual sense this is most true, for those children of God who in spirit abide ever in his house, are also ever full of the praises of God. Communion is the mother of adoration. They fail to praise the Lord who wander far from him, but those who dwell in him are always magnifying him.</p>

The blessedness of sacred worship belongs not to half-hearted, listless worshippers, but to those who throw all their energies into it. Neither prayer, nor praise, nor the hearing of the word will be pleasant or profitable to persons who have left their hearts behind them. A company of pilgrims who had left their hearts at home would be no better than a caravan of carcasses, quite unfit to blend with living saints in adoring the living God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ways </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them,&#39;&#39; </span>or far better, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whose </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ways.&quot; </span>Those who love the ways of God are blessed. When we have God&#39;s ways in our hearts, and our heart in his ways, we are what and where we should be, and hence we shall enjoy the divine approval.</p>

As around a well men meet and converse cheerfully, being refreshed after their journey, so even in the vale of tears, or any other dreary glen, the pilgrims to the skies find sweet solace in brotherly communion and in anticipation of the general assembly above, with its joys unspeakable. Probably there is here a local allusion, which will never now be deciphered, but the general meaning is clear enough. There are joys of pilgrimage which make men forget the discomforts of the road. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rain </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jilleth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pooh.&quot; </span>God gives to his people the supplies they need while traversing the roads which he points out for them. Where there were no natural supplies from below, the pilgrims found an abundant compensation in waters from above, and so also shall all the sacramental host of God&#39;s elect. Ways, which otherwise would have been deserted from want of accommodation, were made into highways abundantly furnished for the travellers&#39; wants, because the great annual pilgrimages led in that direction; even so, Christian converse and the joy of united worship make many duties easy and delightful which else had been difficult and painful.</p>

Under the most favourable circumstances in which earth&#39;s pleasures can be enjoyed, they are not comparable by so much as one in a thousand to the delights of the service of God. To fuel his love, to rejoice in the person of the anointed Saviour, to survey the promises and feel the power of the Holy Ghost in applying precious truth to the soul, is a joy which worldlings cannot understand, but which true believers are ravished with. Even a glimpse at the love of God is better than ages spent in the&#39; pleasures of sense. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>had </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rather </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>doorkeeper </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dwell </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tents </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wickedness.</span>&#39; The lowest station in connection with the Lord&#39;s house is better than the highest position among the godless.

Note how he calls the tabernacle &quot; the house of <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>God ;&quot; there&#39;s where the sweetness lies: if Jehovah be our God, his house, his altars, his doorstep, all become precious to us. We know by experience that where Jesus is within, the outside of the house is better than the noblest chambers where the Son of God is not to be found.</span></p>

Heavenly pilgrims are not left uncomforted or unprotected. The pilgrim nation found both sun and shield in that fiery cloudy pillar which was the symbol of Jehovah&#39;s presence, and the Christian still finds both light and shelter in the Lord his God. A sun for happy days and a shield for dangerous ones. A sun above, a shield around. A light to show the way and a shield to ward off its perils. Blessed are they who journey with such a convoy; the sunny and shady side of life are alike happy to them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grace </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory.&quot; </span>Both in due time, both as needed, both to the full, both with absolute certainty. The Lord has both grace and glory in infinite abundance; Jesus is the fulness of both, and, as his chosen people, we shall receive both as a free gift from the God of our salvation.

What a wide promise! Some apparent good may be withheld, but no real good, no, not one. &quot;All things are yours, and ye are Christ&#39;s, and Christ is God&#39;s.&quot; God has all good, theie is no good apart from him, and there is no good which.he either needs to keep back or will on any account refuse us, if we are but ready to receive it. We must be upright and neither lean to this or that form of evil : and this uprightness must be practical,&#8212;we must <span style='font-style:italic;'>walk </span>in truth and holiness, then shall we be heirs of all things, and as we come of age all things shall be in our actual possession; and, meanwhile, according to our capacity for receiving shall be the measure of the divine bestowal. This is true, not of a favoured few, but of all the saints for evermore.</p>

in the dwelling-place of God. The believer finds a perfect home and rest in God&#39;s altars; or, rather, in the great truths which they represent. Still, his confidence in God is sweetened and strengthened by the knowledge of his minute, universal, providential care. It becomes his admiring delight. &quot;God fails not,&quot; as one has beautifully said, &quot;to find a house for the most <span style='font-style:italic;'>worthless, </span>and a nest for the most <span style='font-style:italic;'>restless </span>of birds.&quot; What confidence this should give us! How we should rest I What repose the soul finds that casts itself on the watchful, tender care of him who provides so fully for the need of all his creatures! We know what the expression of &quot;nest&quot; conveys, just as well as that of &quot; a house.&quot; Is it not a place of security, a shelter from storm, a covert to hide oneself in, from every evil, a protection from all that can harm, &quot;a place to rest in, to nestle in, to joy in?&quot; But there is one thing in these highly privileged birds which strikes us forcibly in our meditations&#8212;they knew not him from whom all this kindness flowed&#8212;they knew neither his heart nor his hand. They enjoyed the rich provisions of his tender care; he thought of everything for their need, but there was no fellowship between them and the Great Giver. From this, O my soul, thou mayest learn a useful lesson. Never rest satisfied with merely frequenting such places, or with having certain privileges there; but rise, in spirit, and seek and find and enjoy direct communion with the living God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. The heart of David turns to God himself. &quot;My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.&quot; &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>New </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Old. </span></span></p>

But though God&#39;s children are all priests by birth, as were the sons of Aaron, they are not all, alas! priests by consecration. (See Exod. xxix.) Comparatively few know their priestly place at the golden ultar. Many of them are doubting as to whether their sins, root and brunch, were all consumed outside the camp; and, consequently, such are afraid to come within the court, and as for being assured of their full justification and sanctification in the risen One, they gravely doubt and fear that such blessedness can ever be their happy lot. Hence that state of soul which answers to priestly consecration at the laver, and happy worship at the golden altar, is unknown and unenjoyed. They are not priests by consecration.</p>

Probably he passed through Bochim, which seems to have been an arid valley, when he marched against the Moabites i nd Ammonites; see 2 Chron. xx. After the victory, the army of Jehoshaphat assembled in a valley, where they blessed the Lord ; and from this circumstance it received the name of Berachah : see ver. 26. Perhaps the word nto&quot;ja in this verse has an allusion to that circumstance; and perhaps the valley of Berachah was, before that glorious occasion, called the valley of Bochim.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dixon. </span></p>

In the use of ordinances we draw near to God, we come into our Father&#39;s presence; in prayer we have secret conference with God ; the soul while it is praying, is as it were parleying with God. In the word we hear God speaking from heaven to us; and how doth every child of God delight to hear his Father&#39;s voice! In the sacrament God kisseth his children with the kisses of his lips; he gives them a smile of his face, and a privy-seal of his love : oh, it is good to draw near to God. It is sweet being in his presence: every true child of God saith, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>day </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>courts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is.betttr </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thousand!&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Watson. </span></p>

But what new energy is given to this magnificent emblem, when we learn from astronomy that he is a grand centre of attraction, and when we, in addition, take in that sublime generalization that the sun is the ultimate source of every form of power existing in the world! The wind wafts the commerce of every nation over the mighty deep; but the heat of the sun has rarefied that air, and set that wind in motion. The descending stream yields a power which grinds your grain, turns your spindles, works your looms, drives your forges; but it is because the sun gathered up the vapour from the ocean, which fell upon the hills, and is finding its way back to the source whence it came. The expansive energy of steam propels your engine; but the force with which it operates is locked up in the coal (the remains of extinct forests stored among your hills), or is derived from the wood that abounds in your forests, which now crown and beautify their summits. Both those primeval and these existing forests drew their subsistence from the sun: it is the chemical force resident in his rays which disengaged their carbon from the atmosphere, and laid it up as a source of power for future use. The animal exerts a force by muscular contraction; he draws it from the vegetable on which he feeds; the vegetable derives it from the sun, whose rays determine its growth. Every time you lift your arm, every time you take a step, you are drawing on the power the sun has given you. When you step into the railway carriage, it is the sunpower that hurries you along. When gentle breezes fan your languid cheek, and when the resistless tornado levels cities in its fury, they are the servants of the sun.

As a sun, he discloses so much of the enormity of guilt, that I am forced to exclaim, &quot;Mine iniquities are like a sore burden, too heavy for me to bear;&quot; but then as a shield, he shows me that he has laid the load on a Surety, who bore it into a land of forgetfulness. As a sun, he makes me daily more and more sensible of the utter impossibility of my working out a righteousness of my own; but then, as a shield, he fastens constantly my thoughts on that righteousness of his Son, which is meritoriously conveyed to all who believe on his name. As a sun, in short, he brings facts to my knowledge, (inasmuch as he brings myself and mine enemies to my knowledge,) which would make the matter of deliverance seem out of reach and hopeless, if he were not at the same time a shield ; but seeing that he is both a shield as well as a sun. the disclosures which he makes as a sun only prepare me for the blessings which he imparts as a shield. Who then shall wonder, that after announcing the character of God, the psalmist should break into expressions of confidence and assurance? It may be, that as the corruption of nature is brought continually before me, deeper and wider and darker, Satan will ply me with the suggestion; &quot;The guiltiness is too inveterate to be eradicated, and too enormous to be pardoned ;&quot; and if God were a sun, and nothing more, it might be hard to put away the suggestion as a device of the father of lies. I might then fear. I might fear God&#39;s holiness, thinking I should never be fitted for communion with Deity; I might fear God&#39;s justice, thinking I should never find acquittal at the last dread assize. But can I fear either, when besides a sun, God is also a shield <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>Can I fear God&#39;s justice, when as a shield he places sufferings to my account, which satisfy the law, even to the last penalty? Can I fear his holiness, when he gives me interest in an obedience which fulfils every precept <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>Does not the one character, that of a shield, help me to scatter those solicitudes, which may well be excited through the operation of the other character, that of a sun? And am I not warranted&#8212;nay, am I not living far below my privilege&#8212;if I fail in deriving from the combination of character a boldness and a confidence, not to be overborne by those suspicions, which have Satan for their author? As a sun, God shows we myself; as a shield, God shows me himself. The sun discloses mine own nothingness; the shield, Divine sufficiency. The one enables me to discern that I deserve nothing but wrath, and can earn nothing but shame; the other, that I have a title to immortality, and may lay claim to an enduring inheritance in heaven. I learn, in short, from God as &quot;a Sun,&quot; that if I have &quot; wages,&quot; I must have eternal death ; but from God as &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Shield,&quot; </span>that if I will receive the &quot;free gift&quot; I may have &quot;eternal life.&quot; Whom then shall I fear? Myself&#8212;confessedly my worst enemy? &quot;The Sun&quot; makes a man stnrt from himself; the &quot;Shield &quot; assures him that he shall be protected agaiust himself and builded up &quot;for a habitation of God through the Spirit.&quot; Shall I shrink from Satan auu the hosts of principalities and powers? The &quot;Sun&quot; shows them awful in their might and vehement in their malice; but the &quot;Shield&quot; exhibits them spoiled and led captive, when Christ died and rose again. Shall I dread death? Indeed the &quot;Sun&quot; makes death terrible, forcing me to read God&#39;s curse in the motionless limbs and mouldering features; but then the &quot;Shield &quot; displays the open sepulchre, the quickened dust, the marvels of a resurrection, the mountain and the ocean and the valley yielding up the sleeping generations. Is death to be dreaded? Take the catalogue of things, which, inasmuch as we<a id='GBS.PA79.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.92.1.0.box.209.301.1298.497.q.60'>
