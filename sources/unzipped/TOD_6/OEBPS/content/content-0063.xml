As he was walking through his hall with his hat on, his cane under his arm, and putting on his gloves, in order to step into his carriage, he overheard his negro, who served him as postillion, saying to another servant, &quot;I suppose, by my Lord&#39;s quitting London to avoid the plague, that his God lives in the country, and not in town.&quot; The poor negro said this in the simplicity of his heart, as really believing a plurality of gods. The speech, however, struck Lord Craven very sensibly, and made him pause. &quot;My God,&quot; thought he, &quot; lives everywhere, and<a id='GBS.PA242.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.255.1.0.box.283.286.1295.239.q.60'>

Lord, pardon this unbelief, and that distrust of thy providence, which made me think of running from thy hand.&quot; He immediately ordered his horses to be taken from the coach, and the baggage to be taken in. He continued in Loudon, was remarkably useful among his sick neighbours, and never caught the infection.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Whitecross&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Anecdotes.</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39; </span></span></p>

For the prophet does not say, Thou shalt not be seized; but, Thou shalt not be afraid. Certainly such a confidence of mind could not be attributed to natural powers, in so menacing and so overwhelming a destruction. For it is natural to mortals, it is implanted in them by God the author and maker of nature, to fear whatever is hurtful and deadly, especially what visibly smites and suddenly destroys. Therefore does he beautifully join together these two things : the first, in saying, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shalt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>afraid</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>the second, by adding, <span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>terror. </span>lie acknowledges that this plague is terrible to nature; and then by his trust in divine protection he promises himself this security, that he shall not fear the evil, which would otherwise make human nature quail. Wherefore, in my judgment, those persons are neither kind <span style='font-style:italic;'>(humani) </span>nor pious who are of opinion that so great a calamity is not to be dreaded by mortals. They neither observe the condition of our nature, nor honour the blessing of divine protection; both of which we see here done by the prophet.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Muscvlus. </span></p>

To the same purpose is the expression of Isaiah: &quot;When tho1i passest through the waters, 1 will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee ; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.&quot;&#39; Isai. xliii. 2. So also Habakkuk iii. 17, 18, &quot;Although the fig tree shall not blossom,&quot; &amp;c. ; and Job v. 19, 20, etc. And therefore here is no ground, if the words be rightly understood, for any man absolutely to presume or conclude that he shall actually be delivered out of any particular danger; much less upon such a presumption wilfully to run into dangers. If such figures, the ornament of all language; such rhetorical, emphatical amplifications be allowed to human writers, and well enough understood in ordinary language ; why not to holy writers as.well, who had to do with men, as well as others; whose end also wad to use such expressions as might affect and move?

His pious and intrepid labours are commemorated in a picture in the Town Hall of Marseilles, in which he is represented in his episcopal habit, attended by his almoners, giving his benediction to the dying. . . . But perhaps the most touching picture extant of the bishop&#39;s humane labours, is to be found in a letter of his own, written to the Bishop of Soissons, Sept. 27, 1720. &#39;Never,&#39; he says, &#39;was desolation greater, nor was ever anything like this.

The Rev. W. Mompesson was rector of Eyam in Derbyshire, in the time of the plague that nearly depopulated the town in the year 1666. During the whole time of the calamity, he performed the functions of the physician, the legislator, and the minister of his afflicted parish; assisting the sick with his medicines, his advice, and his prayers. Tradition still shows a cavern near Eyam, where this worthy pastor used to preach to such of his parishioners as had not caught the distemper. Although the village was almost depopulated, his exertions prevented the spread of the plague to other districts, and he himself survived unharmed.</p>

When Balaam went upon the devil&#39;s errand an angel met him and scared his ass, and the ass ran his foot against the wall, dashed his foot against the wall. The promise is, &quot;Thou shalt not dash thy foot against a stone ;&quot; but he was out of his way, and the angel met him and scared his ass, and his ass made him rush his leg against the wall. Jonah went out of his way when he ran away from God; God bade him go one way, and he went another. Well, what then? were the angels with him for his protection; the very sea would not be quiet till he was thrown overboard: instead of angels to protect him, he had a whale to devour him. I confess indeed, through the free grace and mercy of God, the belly of destruction was made a chamber of preservation to him, but he was out of his way; and instead&#39; of an angel to keep him that he dash not his foot, his whole body was thrown overboard. Says Solomon, &quot;As a bird from her nest, so is a man out of his place:&#39;&#39; so long as the bird is in her nest it is free from the hawk, it is free from the birding-piece, it is free from the nets and gins and snares as long as it is in its nest; but when the bird is off her nest then she is exposed to many dangers. So, so long as a man is in his way, in his place and in his way, he is well and under protection; but when a mau is off his nest, out of his place and out of his way, then is he exposed to all dangers: but be but in your way and then you may assure yourselves of divine protection, and of the management thereof by the hands of angels.

In his other ways of dealing he was shy, and did but lay them in Christ&#39;s way, offering only the occasion, and leaving him to take them up; but in this he is more confident, and industriously pleads it, as a thing which he could better stand to and more confidently avouch. The care of his subtlety herein, lay in the misrepresentation and abuse of it, as may be seen in these particulars: (1) In that he urged this promise to promote a sinful thing, contrary to the general end of all Scripture, which was therefore written &#39;that we sin not.&#39; (2) But more especially in his clipping and mutilating of it. He industriously leaves out that part of it which doth limit and confine the promise of protection to lawful undertakings, such as this was not, and renders it as a general promise of absolute safety, be the action what it will.

unnecessarily thrust themselves into dangers, but in the most abominably sinful actions whatsoever, which would have been a direct contradiction to those many scriptures wherein God threatens to withdraw his hand and leave sinners to the danger of their iniquities; but it is evident that the sense of it is no more than this, &#39;God is with you, while you are with him.&#39; We have a paraphrase of this text, to this purpose, in Prov. iii. 23, &quot;Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble;&quot; where the condition of this safety, pointed to in the word &quot; then,&quot; which leads the promise, is expressly mentioned in the foregoing verses, &quot;My son, let them&quot;&#8212;that is, the precepts of wisdom&#8212; &quot;not depart from thine eyes ....

The fallacy of Satan in this dealing with Scripture is obvious, and Christ might have given this answer, as Bernard hath it, That God promiseth to keep him in his ways, but not in self-created dangers, for that was not his way, but his ruin ; or if a way, it was Satan&#39;s way, but not his.

execution of God&#39;s redeeming plan is an object of admiration. All that the Lord Jesus is in himself; all that he has done; all that he does at the present; and all that he has promised to do for his people, deserves the warmest admiration.

Why? Because I neither have, nor can have any interest in them; they are not mine, nor ever can be; therefore, I cannot take complacent delight in them. But the love of the Christian is a delightful love, (as Mr. Baxter called it,) because there is in the Lord everything that is worthy of infinite and eternal admiration; and then there is the thought which produces a thrill of pleasure,&#8212;whatever I admire I can. in some measure, possess. The illuminated eye of God&#39;s favourite sees everything in the Lord to supply his necessities; everything to satisfy his desires, all his own ; which makes the soul delight itself in the Lord, and he rests in his love. Therefore, the Lord says of the object of his lovingkindness, &quot;He hath set his love upon me&quot;&#8212;he hath renounced sin as the greatest abomination; he hath taken off the heart from all idolatrous attachment to the creature, and placed it fixedly and supremely upon God.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dawson, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Methodist </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Preacher </span>(1778&#8212;1841).</span></p>

A mau&#39;s safety we see lies in his running to the tower (Prov. xxiii. 10); he runs and is safe. And it is the knowledge of this tower that sets a man a running to it.

Then n man is safe when he hath got this tower to be his tower, when he hath gotten God to be his God. Now when we know God, we get him to be our God, and make this tower our tower, Jer. xxiv. 7: &quot;I will give them an heart to know me,</p>
