If from childhood the soul had been educated for God, in habits accordant with its spiritual nature, it would be full of life, love, and sensibility, in harmony with all lovely things in the natural world, beholding the spiritual world through the natural, alive to all excitement from natural and intellectual beauty, and as ready to its duty as a child to its play. What a dreadful destruction of the mind&#39;s inner sensibilities results from a sensual life! What a decline, decay, and paralysis of its intuitive powers, so that the very existence of such a thing as spiritual intuition, in reference to a spiritual world, may be questioned, if not denied!</span></p>

The King of Prussia, though a personal friend of Kant&#39;s, found himself obliged to level his State thunders at some of his doctrines, and terrified him in his advance; else I am persuaded that Kant would have formally delivered Atheism from the professor&#39;s chair, and would have enthroned the horrid ghoulish creed, which privately he professed, in the University of Konigsberg. It required the artillery of a great king to make him pause. The fact is, that as the stomach has been known by means of its natural secretion, to attack not only whatsoever alien body is introduced within it, but also (as John Hunter first showed), sometimes to attack itself and its own organic structure; so, and with the same preternatural extension of instinct, did Kant carry forward his destroying functions, until he turned them upon his own hopes, and the pledges of his own superiority to the dog, the ape, the worm.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>B. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cheecer, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Voices </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Nature,&quot; </span>1852.</p>

It does not rejoice over much in winter&#39;s copious rain, nor does it droop under the drought and the burning sun of summer. Neither heavy weights which men place upon its head, nor the importunate urgency of the wind, can sway it aside from perfect uprightness. There it stands, looking calmly down upou the world below, and patiently yielding its large clusters of golden fruit from generation to generation.

The excessive dryness of this arid tract, where rain seldom falls, is such that wheat refuses to grow, and even barley, maize, and Caffrc corn, (Holcus sorghum.) afford the husbandman only a scanty and uncertain crop. The hot blasts from the south are scarcely supportable even by the native himself, and yet here forests of date palms flourish, and form a screen impervious to the rays of the sun, beneath the shade of which the lemon, the orange, and the pomegranate, are cherished, and the vine climbs up by means of its twisted tetidrils;&#39; and although reared in constant shade, all these fruits acquire a more delicious flavour than in what would seem a more favourable climate.

Without believing (as the Maronites or Christian inhabitants of the mountains do), that the seven very ancient cedars which yet remain in the neighbourhood of the village of Eden in Lebanon are the remains of the identical forest which furnished Solomon with timber for the Temple, full three thousand years ago, they can yet be proved to be of very great antiquity. These very cedars were visited by Belonius in 1550, nearly three hundred years ago, who found them twentyeight in number. Rawolf, in 1575, makes them twenty-four. Dandini, in 1600, and Thevenot about fifty years after, make them twenty-three. Maundrell, in 1696, found them reduced to sixteen. Pococke, in 1738, found fifteen standing, and a sixteenth recently blown down, or (may we not conjecture ?) shivered by the voice of God. In 1810, Burckhardt counted eleven or twelve; and Dr. Richardson, in 1818, states them to be no more than seven. There cannot be a doubt, then, that thess cedars which were esteemed ancient nearly three hundred years ago, must be of a very great antiquity; and yet they are described by the last of these travellers as &quot;large, and tall, and beautiful, the most picturesque productions of the vegetable world that we had seen.&quot; The oldest are large and massy, rearing their heads to an enormous height, and spreading their branches afar. Pococke also remarks, that &quot;the young cedars are not easily known from pines. I observed, they bear a <span style='font-style:italic;'>greater </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>quantity </span>of fruit than the largo ones.&quot; This shows that the old ones still bear fruit, though not so abundantly as the young cedars, which, according to Richardson, are very productive, and cast many seeds annually. How appropriate, then, and full of meaning, is the imagery of the Psalmist: &quot;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>R. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>AfCheyne. </span></p>

The court or open area in the centre of an eastern dwelling, and especially the court of any great and stately dwelling, was often adorned with a tree, or sometimes with more than one, for beauty, for shade, and, as it might be, for fruit. There sometimes the palm tree, planted by the cool fountain, shot up its tall trunk toward the sky, and waved its green top, far above tho roof, in the sun-light and the breeze. There sometimes the olive, transplanted from the rocky hillside, may have flourished under the protection and culture of the household, and may have rewarded their care with the rich abundance of its nutritious berries. With such images in his mind, the Psalmist, having spoken of the brief prosperity of the wicked, and having compared it with the springing and flourishing of the grass, which grows to its little height only to be immediately cut down, naturally and beautifully compares the righteous, not with the deciduous herbage, but with the hardy tree that lives on through the summer&#39;s drought and the winter&#39;s storms, and from season to season still renews its growth. These trees of righteousness, as the poet conceives of them, are &quot;planted in the house of the Lord ;&quot; they stand fair and &quot;flowering in the courts of our God &quot;&#8212;even &quot; in old age they bring forth fruit &quot; &#8212;they are &quot; full of sap and flourishing&quot;&#8212;they are living memorials &quot;to show that the Lord is faithful,&quot; and that those who trust in him shall never be confounded.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Leonard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bacon, </span>1845.</p>

That believers be fat; that is, by the heavenly juice, sap, or fatness of the true olive, of Christ himself, as Kom. xi. 17. This is the principle of spiritual life and grace derived from him. When this abounds in them, so as to give them strength and vigour in the exercise of grace, to keep them from decays and withering, they are said to be fat; which, in the Scripture phrase, is strong and healthy. 2. That they flourish in the greenness (as the word is) and verdure of profession; for vigorous grace will produce a flourishing profession. 3.

naturally vigorous, healthy, and strong; and would it were not more rare to see any spiritually so at the same season! But this is here promised unto believers as an especial grace and privilege, beyond what can be represented in the growth or fruit-bearing of plants and trees. The grace intended is, that when believers are under all sorts of bodily and natural decays, and, it may be, have been overtaken with spiritual decays also, there is provision made in the covenant to render them fat, flourishing, and fruitful,&#8212;vigorous in the power of internal gtace, and flourishing in the expression of it in all duties of obedience; which is that which we now inquire after. Blessed be God for this good word of his grace, that he hath given us such encouragement against all the decays and temptations of old age which we have to conflict withal!</span></p>
