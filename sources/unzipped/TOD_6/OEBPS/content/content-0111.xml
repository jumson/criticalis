Only through these do we attain that lasting second birth, of which the eagle is the emblem, and an unfading youth of heart the inestimable fruit. Ye who are young in years, seek this undying youth above all the joys of early life! Recover it, ye middle-aged, in living fellowship with him who maketh all things new within! Preserve it, old friends of God and of his Christ, as your fairest crown here on earth, and the earnest of your bliss in heaven.

Since then he had been a wanderer by sea and laud; but the memory of her faith and love moved his heart. The appeals made to him were blessed by the Spirit of God. His life was spared, and proved the reality of his conversion.</p>

If his stomach refuse meat, or cannot answer it with digestion, will he put him out of doors? No; when the Shunamite&#39;s son complains of his bead, she lays him in her bosom. A mother is good to all the fruit of her womb, most kind to the sick infant: when it lies with its eyes fixed on her, not able to declare its grief, or to call for what it desires, this doubles her compassion: &#39;So the Lord doth pity us, remembering our frame, considering that we are but dust&#39;; that our soul works by a lame instrument; and therefore he requires not that of an elemental composition, which he doth of angelical spirits. The son is commanded to write out such a copy fairly ; he doth his best, far short of the original; yet the father doth not chide, but encourage him. Or he gives him a bow nud arrows, bids him shoot to such a mark: he draws his utmost strength, lets go cheerfully; the arrow drops far short, yet the son is praised, the father pleased. Temptation assaults us, lust buffets us, secular business diverts us, manifold is our weakness, but not beyond our Father&#39;s forgiveness: &#39;He will spare us, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him,&#39; Mai. iii. 17.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Adams. </span></p>

The one, if no untimely accident oppress it, soon arrives at the full period of its perfection,&#8212;is suffered to triumph for a few moments, and is plucked up by the roots in the very pride and gayest stage of its being ;&#8212;or if it happens to escape the hands of violence, in a few days it necessarily sickens of itself and dies away. Man likewise, though his progress is slower, and his duration somewhat longer, yet the periods of his growth and declension are nearly the same, both in the nature and manner of them. If he escapes the dangers which threaten his tenderer years, he is soon got into the full maturity and strength of life; and if he is so fortunate as not to be hurried out of it then by accidents, by his own folly and intemperance&#8212;if he escapes these, he naturally decays of himself,&#8212;a period comes fast upon him, beyond which he was not made to last. Like flowers or fruits which may be plucked up by force before the time of their maturity, yet cannot be made to outgrow the period when they are to fade and drop of themselves; when that comes, the hand of nature then plucks them both off, and no art of the botanist can uphold the one, or skill of the physician preserve the other, beyond the periods to which their original frames and constitutions were made to extend. As God has appointed and determined the several growths and decays of the vegetable race, so he seems as evidently to have prescribed the same laws to man, as well as all living creatures, in the first rudiments of which there are contained the specific powers of their growth, duration and extinction; and when the evolutions of those animal powers are exhausted and run down, the creature expires and dies of itself, as ripe fruit falls from the tree, or a flower preserved beyond its bloom, drops and perishes upon the stalk.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Lawrence </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sterne, </span>1713&#8212;1768.</p>

The glory of his dominion. The heavens are the most stately and comely pieces of the creation; his majesty is there most visible, his glory most spleudid, Ps. .\ix. 1. In heaven his dominion is more acknowledged by the ange)s : his dominion is not disputed there by the angels that attend him, as it is on earth by the rebels that arm themselves against him. 2. The supremacy of his empire. The heavens are the loftiest part of the creation, and the only fit palace for him. 3. Peculiarity of this dominion. He rules in the heavens alone, Jtiis authority is not delegated to any creature, he rules the blessed spirits by himself: but he rules men that are on his footstool by others of the same kind, men of their own nature. 4. The vastness of his empire. The earth is but a spot to the heavens. What is England in a map to the whole earth, but a spot you may cover with your finger; much less must the whole earth be to the extended heavens. You cannot conceive the many millions of little particles that are in the earth ; and if all put together be but one point to that place where the throne of God is seated, how vast must his empire be! He rules there over the angels, which excel in strength, those hosts of his which do his pleasure, in comparison of whom all the men in the world, and the power of the greatest potentates, is no more than the strength of an ant or fly. And since his throne is in the heavens, it will follow that all things under the heaven are part of his dominion ; the inferior things of earth cannot but be subject to him; and it necessarily includes his influence on all things below, because the heavens are the cause of all the motion in the world. See Hosea ii. 21, 22. 5. The easiness of managing this government. His throne being placed on high, he cannot but behold all things that are done below; the height of a place gives advantage to a clear eye to behold things below it. &quot;7%&#171;Lord <span style='font-style:italic;'>looked </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heaven </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>children </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>see </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>if </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>were </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>any </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>did </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>undei-stand,&#39;&#39; </span>Ps. xiv. 2. He looks not down from heaven as if his presence were confined there, but he looks down majestically, and by way of authority. 6. Duration of it. The heavens are incorruptible, his throne is placed there in an incorruptible state. The throne of God outlives the dissolution of the world. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Condensed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Charnock. </span></p>

It is improperly taken, either for things that have both beginning and end, as everlasting mountains ; divers such phrases in Scripture; or for things that have a beginning but shall have no end; so are angels and men&#39;s souls eternal; so, eternal life, eternal fire. But God calls himself, &quot; I AM,&quot; Exod. iii. 14 : I am what I have heen, I have been what I am, what I am and have been I shall be.

Thou turnest man to destruction, and again sayest, Return: &quot;even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God,&quot; Ps. xc. 2 ; the sole umpire and measurer of beginning and ending. Secondly, over all <span style='font-style:italic;'>places, </span>heaven, earth, hell, Ps. exxxv. 6. Kings are limited, and cannot do many things they desire: they cannot command the sun to stand still, nor the wind to blow which way they would : in the lofty air, in the depths of the sea no king reigns. They fondly flatter the pope with his long arms that they reach to purgatory; (but indeed both power and place are alike imaginary ;) it is Christ alone that hath the keys of all places. Thirdly, over all <span style='font-style:italic;'>creatures; </span>binding the influences of Pleiades, and loosing the bands of Orion, Job xxxviii. 31; commanding the fire against the nature of it, to descend, 2 Kings i. 12; creating and ruling the stars, Amos v. 8; overruling the<a id='GBS.PA472.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.485.1.0.box.251.282.1297.564.q.60'>

In both fire and water, those two raging elements that have no mercy, he shows mercy; delivers us from both in both. He calls the fowls, and they come; the beasts, and they hear: the trees, and they spring to obey him. He hath a raven for Elijah, a gourd for Jonah, a dog for Lazarus. Makes the leviathan, the hugest living creature, preserve his prophet. That <sub>;</sub>a terrible lion should be killed, as was by Samson; or not kill, as they f jrbore Daniel ; or kill and not eat, as that prophet, 1 Kings xiii. : here was the Lord. Over metals; he makes iron to swim, stones to cleave asunder. Over the devils ; they must obey him though unwillingly. But they continually rebel against him, and break his will? They do indeed against his complacency, not against his permission. There is then no time, not the hour of death; no place, not the sorest torment; no creature, not the devil ; but the Lord can deliver us from them. Therefore at all times, in all places, and against all creatures, let us trust in him for deliverance.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Adams. </span></span></p>
