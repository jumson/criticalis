Since the appearance of objects, and the ideas which we form of them, are thus affected by extraneous circumstances, it follows, that no two persons will form precisely the same ideas of any object, unless they view it in the same light, or are placed with respect to it in the same situation.</p>

We must place ourselves and our sins in the centre of that circle which is irradiated by the light of his countenance where all his infinite perfections are clearly displayed, where his awful majesty is seen, where his concentrated glories blaze, and burn, and dazzzle, with insufferable brightness. And in order to this, we must, in thought, leave our dark and sinful world, where God is unseen and almost forgotten, and where consequently, the evil of sinning against him cannot be fully perceived&#8212;and mount up to heaven, the peculiar habitation of his holiness and glory, where he does not, as here, conceal himself behind the veil of his works, and of second causes, but shines forth the unveiled God, and is seen as he is.</p>

Now here he further sets forth the same by the effects thereof in reference to that present argument he hath in hand. 1. That our days do as it were go backward in his wrath : that whereas God gave us being to live, our life and our being are nothing else but a going backward, as it were, to death and to nothing. Even as if a stranger being suddenly rapt and carried mid-way to his home, where are all his comforts, he should spend all the time that is behind, not in going forward to his home, but in going backward to the place from which he was suddenly brought. All the sons of Adam as soon as they have being and live are brought suddenly a great part of their way: and whereas they should go forward and live longer and longer, they from their first beginning to live go backward again to death and to nothing. This is the sum in effect of that which the Lord saith in the beginning of the Psalm, (ver. 8:) <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bringest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>destruction; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saying, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Return </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>again, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sons </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Adiim:&quot; </span>as if he should say, Thou makest a man, and when he is made, he in thy wrath doth haste to nothing else but destruction and to be marred again.

This is one of the customs of the East. It naturally springs up among any people who have few books, or none; where the masses are unable to read, and where, therefore, they are dependent for excitement or information on those who can address the ear, and who recite, in prose or verse, traditionary tales and popular legends. I dare say this sort of thing would be much in repute among the Israelites themselves during their detention in the wilderness, and that it served to beguile for them many a tedious hour. It is by this custom, then, that we venture to illustrate the statement of the text.</p>

seven hundred years to four hundred and three hundred, as we see in the uge of Arphaxad, Saluh, Heber : yea, they fell to two hundred and odd years, as we read of Peleg, Hen, Serug, and Tharah ; yea, they came down to less than two hundred years. In the space of a few years man&#39;s life was again cut shorter by almost half, if not a full half. We read that Abraham lived but one hundred and seventy-five years, so that man&#39;s age ran very low then.

For he sets the bounds of man&#39;s life thus: &quot;The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.&quot; Ps. sc. 10. Eighty years is the utmost limit he sets man&#39;s life at, <span style='font-style:italic;'>i.e., </span>in the most ordinary and common account of man&#39;s life. Though some are of the opinion that these words do not give an account of the duration of man&#39;s life in general, but refer to the short lives of the Israelites in the wilderness, yet I do not see but it may take in both; and Moses who composed the Psalm, lived a hundred and twenty years himself, yet he might speak of the common term of man&#39;s life, and what usually happened to the generality of men.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Edwards. </span></span></p>

And though they are full of trouble, and cry aloud, yet the Divine anger does not so penetrate their hearts as to abate their pride and fierceness. The minds of the godly alone are wounded with the wrath of God; nor do they wait for his thundeibolts, to which the reprobate hold out their hard and iron necks, but they tremble the very moment when God moves only his little finger.

But yet in regard of the power of God&#39;s anger, which was now very great and grievous, their fear of God was not answerable and proportionable ; then it is apparent that Moses and his people failed in respect of the measure of the fear of God which they ought to have had, in regard of the greatness and gricvousness of the judgments of God upon them.</p>

The wicked man&#39;s fear of God is a measure of the wrath of God.

There is such a fear and such a dread of that God into whose immediate presence he feels himself about to be ushered, that even they who love him best, and charm him most, shrink from the wildness of his gaze and the fearfulness of his speech.

See a good man, how little he pleascth himself in any action of his life, in any performance of duty that he does. He can never think that he does well enough whatever he does, but still desires to do otherwise, and would fain do better. There is an affection of modesty and humility which still accompanies real piety, and every pious man is an humble, modest man, and never reckons himself a perfect proficient, or to be advanced above a teaching, but is content and covetous to be a continual learner; to know more than he knows and to do better than he does; yea, and thinks it no disparagement to his graces at all to take advice, and to seek instruction where it is to be had.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Edm. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Barker&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Funeral </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lady </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Capell, </span>1661.</p>

An Italian philosopher expressed in his motto that time was his estate; an estate, indeed, that will produce nothing without cultivation, but will always abundantly repay the labours of industry, and satisfy the most extensive desires, if no part of it be suffered to lie waste by negligence, to be overrun by noxious plants, or laid out for show rather than for use.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Johnson. </span></p>

Therefore the way to get wisdom is to apply your hearts unto it, as if it were your calling nnd living, to which you were bound &#39;prentices.

books, and yet never prove scholars ; but from that day when a man begins to apply his heart unto wisdom, he learneth more in a month after than he did in a year before, nay, than ever he did in his life. Even as you see the wicked, because they apply their hearts to wickedness, how fast they proceed, how easily and how quickly they become perfect swearers, expert drunkards, cunning deceivers, so if ye could apply your hearts as thoroughly to knowledge and goodness, you might become like the apostle which teacheth you. Therefore, when Solomon sheweth men the way how to come by wisdom, he speaks often of the heart, as, &quot;Give thine heart to wisdom,&quot; &quot;let wisdom enter into thine heart,&quot; &quot; get wisdom,&quot; &quot;keep wisdom,&quot; &quot;embrace wisdom,&quot; Prov. ii. 10, iv. 5, xiii. 8, as though a man went a wooing for wisdom. Wisdom is like God&#39;s daughter, that he giveth to the man that loveth her, and sueth for her, and meaneth to set her at his heart. Thus we have learned how to apply knowledge that it may do us good ; not to our ears, like them which hear sermons only, nor to our tongues, like them which make table-talk of religion, but to our hearts, that we may say with the virgin, &quot;My heart doth magnify the Lord,&quot; Luke i., and the heart will apply it to the ear and to the tongue, as Christ saith, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>abundance </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mouth </span>s^ea&amp;e^V,&quot; Matt. xii. 34.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Smith, </span></span></p>

The wrath of God thought on makes us think of death. . . . Let us often think of the wrath of God, and let the thought of it so far work upon us, as to keep us in a constant awe and fear of God ; and let this fear drive us to God by prayer, that fearing as we ought, we may pray as we are commanded, and praying, we may prevent the wrath of God. If our present sorrows do not move us, God will send greater; and when our sorrows are grown too great for us, we shall have little heart or comfort to pray. Let our fears then quicken our prayers; and let our prayers be such as are able to overcome our fears; so both ways shall we be happy, in that our fears have taught us to pray, and our prayers have made us to fear no more.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Christopher </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Shute, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Ars </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pie </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moriendi</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>or, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>true </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Accomptant. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon,&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>etc.. </span>1658.</p>

They will not apply their hearts unto wisdom until they are brought to the numbering of their days. And how are you to be brought, my brethren? The most surprising thing in the text is, that it should be in the form of a prayer. It is necessary that God should interfere to make men number their days. We call this surprising. What! is there not enough to make us feel our frailty, without an actual, supernatural impression? What! are there not lessons enough of that frailty without any new teaching from above? Go into our churchyards&#8212;all ages sjicak to all ranks. Can we need more to prove to us the uncertainty of life? Go into mourning families&#8212; and where are they not to be found ?&#8212;in this it is the old, in that it is the young, whom death has removed&#8212;and is there not eloquence in tears to persuade us that we are mortal? Can it be that in treading every day on the dust of our fathers, and meeting every day with funerals of our brethren, we shall not yet bo practically taught to number our days, unless God print the truth on our<a id='GBS.PA224.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.237.1.0.box.266.294.1294.1274.q.60'>
hearts, through some special operation of his Spirit? It is not thus in other things. In other things the frequency of the occurrence makes us expect it. The husbandman does not pray to be made believe that the seed must be buried and die before it will germinate. This has been the course of the grain of every one else, and where there is so much experience what room is there for prayer? The mariner does not pray to be taught that the needle of his compass points towards the north. The needle of every compass has so pointed since the secret was discovered, and he has not to ask when he is already so sure. The benighted man does not pray to be made to feel that the sun will rise in a few hours. Morning has succeeded to night since the world was made, and why should he ask what he knows too well to doubt? But in none of these things is there greater room for assurance than we have each one for himself, in regard to its being appointed to him once to die. Nevertheless, we must pray to be made to know&#8212;to be made to feel&#8212;that we are to die, in the face of an experience which is certainly not less than that of the parties to whom we have referred. This is a petition that we may believe, believe as they do: for they act on their belief in the fact which this experience incontestably attests. And we may say of this, that it is amongst the strangest of the strange things that may be affirmed of human nature, that whilst, in regard to inferior concerns, we can carefully avail ourselves of experience, taking care to register its decisions and to deduce from them rules for our guidance&#8212;in the mightiest concern of all we can act as though experience had furnished no evidence, and we were left without matter from which to draw inferences. And, nevertheless, in regard to nothing else is the experience so uniform. The grain does not always germinate&#8212;but every man dies. The needle does not always point due north&#8212;but every man dies. The sun does not cross the horizon in every place in every twenty-four hours&#8212;but every man dies. Yet we must pray&#8212;pray as for the revelation of a mystery hidden from our gaze&#8212;we must pray to be made to know&#8212;to be made to believe&#8212;that every man dies! For I call it not belief, and our text calls it not belief, in the shortness of life and the certainty of death, which allows men to live without thought of eternity, without anxiety as to the soul, or without an effort to secure to themselves salvation. I call it not belief&#8212;no, no, anything rather than belief. Men are rational beings, beings of forethought, disposed to make provision for what they feel to be inevitable; and if there were not a practical infidelity as to their own mortality, they could not be practically reckless as to their own safety.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Melvill. </span></span></p>

Secondly, that man&#39;s time is set, and his bounds appointed, which he cannot pass, no more than the Egyptians could pass the sea; and therefore Moses saith, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Teach </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>number </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>days,&quot; </span>as though there were a number of our days. Thirdly, that our days are few, as though we were sent into this world but to see it; aud therefore Moses, speaking of our life, speaks of days, not of years, nor of months, nor of weeks; but <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Teach </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>number </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>days,&quot; </span>shewing that it is an easy thing even for a man to number his days, they bo so few. Fourthly, the aptness of man to forget death rather than anything else; and therefore Moses prayeth the Lord to teach him to number his days, as though they were still slipping out of his mind. Lastly, that to remember how short a time we have to live, will make us apply our hearts to that which is good.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Smith. </span></p>
