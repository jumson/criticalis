This protection is constant&#8212;they <span style='font-style:italic;'>abide </span>under it, and it is all-sufficient, for it is the shadow of <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Almighty, </span>whose omnipotence will surely screen them from all attack. No shelter can be imagined at all comparable to the protection of Jehovah&#39;s own shadow. The Almighty himself is where his shadow is, and hence those who dwell in his secret place are shielded by himself. What a shade in the day of noxious heat! What a refuge in the hour of deadly storm! Communion with God is safety. The more closely we cling to our Almighty Father the more confident may we be.</p>

It is but poor comfort to say &#39; the Lord is a refuge,&#39; but to say he is <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>refuge, is the essence of consolation. Those who believe should also speak &#8212;&quot; I will say,&quot;&#39; for such bold avowals honour God and lead others to seek the same confidence. Men are apt enough to proclaim their doubts, and even to boast of them, indeed there is a party nowadays of the most audacious pre-&#39; tenders to culture and thought, who glory in casting suspicion upon every thing: hence it becomes the duty of all true believers to speak out and testify with calm courage to their own well-grounded reliance upon their God. Let others say-what they will, be it ours to say of the Lord, &quot;he is our <span style='font-style:italic;'>refuge.&#39;&#39; </span>But what we say we must prove by our actions, we must fly to the Lord for shelter, and not to an arm of flesh. The bird flies away to the thicket, and the fox hastens to its hole, every creature uses its refuge in the hour of danger, and even so in all peril or fear of peril let us flee unto Jehovah, the Eternal Protector of his own. Let us, when we are secure in the Lord, rejoice that our position is unassailable, for he is our <span style='font-style:italic;'>fortress </span>as well as our refuge. No moat, portcullis, drawbridge, wall, battlement and donjohn, could make us so secure as we arc when the attributes of the Lord of Hosts environ us around. Behold this day the Lord is to us instead of walls and bulwarks! Our ramparts defy the leagured hosts of hell. Foes in flesh, and foes in ghostly guise are alike baulked of their prey when the Lord of Hosts stands between us and their fury, and all other evil forces are turned aside. Walls cannot keep out the pestilence, but the Lord can.</p>

Faith by cheering the heart keeps it free from the fear which, in times of pestilence, kills more than the plague itself. It will not in all cases ward off disease and death, but where the man is such as the first verse describes, it will assuredly render him immortal where others die; if all the saints are not so sheltered it is because they have not all such a close abiding with God, and consequently not such confidence in the promise. Such special faith is not given to all, for there are diversities in the measure of faith. It is not of all believers that the psalmist sings, but only of those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High. Too many among us are weak in faith, and in fact place more reliance in a phial or a globule than in the Lord and giver of life, and if we die of pestilence as others die it is because we acted like others, and did not in patience possess our souls. The great merey is that in such a case our deaths are blessed, and it is well with us, for we are for ever with the Lord. Pestilence to the saints shall not be noisome but the messenger of heaven.</p>

Night is the congenial hour of horrors, when alarms walk abroad like beasts of prey, or ghouls from among the tombs; our fears turn the sweet season of repose into one of dread, and though angels are abroad and fill our chambers, we dream of demons and dire visitants from hell. Blessed is that communion with God which renders us impervious to midnight frights, and horrors born of darkness. Not to be afraid is in itself an unspeakable blessing, since for every suffering which we endure from real injury we are tormented by a thousand griefs which arise from fear only. The shadow of the Almighty removes all gloom from the shadow of night : once covered by the divine wing, we care not what winged terrors may fly abroad in the earth. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Nor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>arrow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flieth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>day.&quot; </span>Cunning foes lie in ambuscade, and aim the deadly shaft at our hearts, but we do not fear them, and have no cause to do so. That arrow is not made which can destroy the righteous, for the Lord hath said, &quot;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.&quot; In times of great danger those who have made the Lord their refuge, and therefore have refused to use the carnal weapon, have been singularly preserved; the annals of the Quakers bear good evidence to this; yet probably the main thought is, that from the cowardly attacks of crafty malice those who walk by faith shall be protected, from cunning heresies they shall be preserved, and in sudden temptations they shall be secured from harm. Day has its perils as well as night, arrows more deadly than those poisoned by the Indian are flying noise lessly through the air, and we shall be their victims unless we find both shield and buckler in our God. O believer, dwell under the shadow of the Lord, and none of the archers shall destroy thee, they may shoot at thee and wound thee grievously, but thy bow shall abide in strength. When Satan&#39;s quiver shall be empty thou shalt remain uninjured by his craft and cruelty, yea, his broken darts shall be to thee as trophies of the truth and power of the Lord thy God.</p>

Remember that the voice which saith &quot; thou shalt not fear&quot; is that of God himself, who hereby pledges his word for the safety of those who abide under his shadow, nay, not for their safety only, but for their serenity.

How true is this of the plague of moral evil, of heresy, and of backsliding. Whole nations are infected, yet the man who communes with God is not affected by the contagion; he holds the truth when falsehood is all the fashion. Professors all around him are plague-smitten, the church is wasted, the very life of religion decays, but in the same place and time, in fellowship with God, the believer renews his youth, and his soul knows no sickness. In a measure this also is true of physical evil : the Lord still puts a difference between Israel and Egypt in the day of his plagues. Sennacherib&#39;s army is blasted, but Jerusalem is in health.</p>

Joshua and Caleb verified this promise. The Puritan preachers during the plague of London must have been much impressed with this verse as they came out of their hiding-places to proclaim mercy and judgment to the dissolute ago which was so soiely visited with the pest. The sight of God&#39;s judgments softens the heart, excites a solemn awe, creates gratitude, and so stirs up the deepest kind of aduiation. It is such a sight as none of us would wish to see, and yet if we did see it we might thus be lifted up to the very noblest style of manhood. Let us but watch providence, and we shall find ourselves living in a school where examples of the ultimate reward of sin are very plentiful. One case may not be judged alone lest we misjudge, but instances of divine visitation will be plentiful in the memory of any attentive observer of men and things; from all these put together we may fairly draw conclusions, and unless we shut our eyes to that which is selfevident, we shall soon perceive that there is after all a moral ruler over the sons of men, who sooner or later rewards the ungodly with due punishment.</p>

Before expounding these verses I cannot refrain from recording a personal incident illustrating their power to soothe the heart, when they are applied by the Holy Spirit. In the year 1854, when I had scarcely been in London twelve months, the neighbourhood in which I laboured was visited by Asiatic cholera, and my congregation suffered from its inroads. Family after family summoned me to the bedside of the smitten, and almost every day I was called to visit the grave. I gave myself up with youthful ardour to the visitation of the sick, and was sent for from all corners of the district by persons of all ranks and religions. I became weary in body and sick at heart. My friends seemed falling one by one, and I felt or fancied that I was sickening like those around me. A little more work and weeping would have laid me low among the rest; I felt that my burden was heavier than I could bear, and I was ready to sink under it. As God would have it, I was returning mournfully home from a funeral, when my curiosity led me to read a paper which was wafered up in a shoemaker&#39;s window in the Dover Road. It did not look like a trade announcement, nor was it, for it bore in a good bold handwriting these words :&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Because </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>refuge, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>even </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>most </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>High, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>habitation</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ttil </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>befall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>neither </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>any </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>plague </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nigh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dwelling.&#39;&#39; </span>The effect upon my heart was immediate. Faith appropriated the passage as her own. I felt secure, refreshed, girt with immortality. I went on with my visitation of the dying in a calm and peaceful spirit; I felt no fear of evil, and I suffered no harm. The providence which moved the tradesman to place those verses in his window I gratefully acknowledge, and in the remembrance of its marvellous power I udore the Lord my God.</p>

Though faith claims no merit of its own, yet the Lord rewards it wherever he sees it. He who <span style='font-style:italic;'>makes </span>God his refuge shall find him a refuge; he who dwells in God shall find his dwelling protected. We must <span style='font-style:italic;'>make </span>the Lord our habitation by choosing him for our trust and rest, and then we shall receive immunity from harm; no evil shall touch us personally, and no stroke of judgment shall assail our household. The <span style='font-style:italic;'>dwelling </span>here intended by the original was only a tent, yet the frail covering would prove to be a sufficient shelter from harm of all sorts. It matters little whether our abode be a gipsey&#39;s hut or a monarch&#39;s palace if the soul has made the Most High its habitation. Get into God and you dwell in all good, and ill is banished far away. It is not because we are perfect or highly esteemed among men that we can hope for shelter iu the day of evil, but because our refuge is the Eternal God, and our faith has learned to hide beneath his sheltering wing.</p>

They are the body-guard of the princes of the blood imperial of heaven, and they have received commission from their Lord and ours to watch carefully over all the interests of the faithful. When men have a charge they become doubly careful, and therefore the angels are represented as bidden by God himself to see to it that the elect are secured. It is down in the marching orders of the hosts of heaven that they take special note of the people who dwell in God. It is not to be wondered at that the servants are bidden to be careful of the comfort of their Master&#39;s guests; and we may be quite sure that when they are specially charged by the Lord himself they will carefully discharge the duty imposed upon them. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>To </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>keep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ways.&quot; </span>To be a body-guard, a garrison to the body, soul, and spirit of the saint. The limit of this protection &quot; in all thy ways&quot; is yet no limit to the heart which is right with God. It is not the way of the believer to go out of his way. He keeps in the way, and then the angels keep him. The protection here promised is exceeding broad as to place, for it refers to <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>our ways, and what do we wish for more F How angels thus keep us we cannot tell. Whether they repel demons, counteract spiritual plots, or even ward off the subtler physical forces of disease, we do not know. Perhaps we shall one day stand amazed at the multiplied services which the unseen bands have rendered to us.</p>

None abide in intimate fellowship with God unless they possess a warm affection towards God, and an intelligent trust in him; these gifts of grace are precious in Jehovah&#39;s eyes, and wherever he sees them he smiles upon them. How elevated is the standing which the Lord gives to the believer. We ought to covet it right earnestly. If we climb on high it may be dangerous, but if God sets us there it is glorious.</span></p>

In addition to all which, they had to be perpetually on their guard against the insidious attacks of the savage monsters and reptiles of &quot;that great and terrible wilderness,&quot; as Moses describes it on another occasion, &quot;wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought; where there was no water&quot; (Deut. viii. 15) ; and where, also, as we learn from other parts of Scripture, bears, lions, leopards or tigers, and &quot;the wolf of the evening,&quot; as Jeremiah has beautifully expressed it, prowled without restraint.
