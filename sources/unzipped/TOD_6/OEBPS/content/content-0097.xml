Under the most terrible aspect the Lord is still to be praised. Many profess to admire the milder beams of the sun of righteousness, but burn with rebellion against its more flaming radinnce : so it ought not to be : we are bound to praise a terrible God and worship him who casts the wicked down to hell. Did not Israel praise him &quot;who overthrew Pharaoh and his hosts in the Red Sea, for his mercy endureth for ever.&quot; The terrible Avenger is to be praised, as well as the loving Redeemer. Against this the sympathy of man&#39;s evil heart with sin rebels; it cries out for an effeminate God in whom pity has strangled justice. The well-instructed servants of Jehovah praise him in all the aspects. of his character, whether terrible or tender.

Men in these days are continually arraigning the Lord&#39;s government, and setting up to judge whether he does right or not; but saintly men in the olden time were of another mind, they were sure that what the Loid did was just, and instead of calling him to account they humbly submitted themselves to his will, rejoicing in the firm persuasion that with his whole omnipotence God was pledged to promote righteousness, and work justice among all his creatures. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(loat </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>establish </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>equity.&quot; </span>Not a court of equity merely, but equity itself thou dost set up, and that not for a time or upon an occasion, but as an established institution, stable as thy throne. Not even for the sake of mercy does the Lord remove or injure the equity of his moral government: both in providence and in grace he is careful to conserve the immaculate purity of his justice. Most kingdoms have an establishment of some kind, and generally it is inequitable; here we have an establishment which is equity itself.

they enjoyed an upright government within their own borders, and acted with integrity towards their neighbours. That kingcraft which delights in cunning, favouritism, and brute force is us opposite to the divine kingship as darkness to light. The palace of Jehovah is no robber&#39;s fortress nor despot&#39;s castle, built on dungeons, with stones carved by slaves, and cemented with the blood of toiling serfs. The annals of most human governments have been written in the tears of the downtrodden, and the curses of the oppressed: the chronicles of the Lord&#39;s kingdom are of another sort, truth shines in each line, goodness in every syllable, and justice in every letter. Glory be to the name of the King, whose gentle glory beams from between the cherubic wings.</span></p>

He shines upon us from under the veiling wings of cherubim, and above the seat of mercy, therefore let us come <span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>worship </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>footstool. </span>When he reveals himself in Christ Jesus, as our reconciled God, who allows us to approach even to his throne, it becomes us to unite earnestness and humility, joy and adoration, and, while we exalt him, prostrate ourselves in the dust before him.

Lord God of Sabaoth!&quot; Holiness is the harmony of all the virtues. The Lord has not one glorious attribute alone, or in excess, but all glories are in him as a whole; this is the crown of his honour and the honour of his crown. His power is not his choicest jewel, nor his sovereignty, but his holiness. In this all comprehensive moral excellence he would have his creatures take delight, and when they do so their delight is evidence that their hearts have been renewed, and they themselves have been made partakers of his holiness. The gods of the heathen were, according to their own votaries, lustful, cruel, and brutish ; their only claim to reverence lay in their supposed potency over human destinies: who would not far rather adore Jehovah, whose character is unsullied purity, unswerving justice, unbending truth, unbounded love, in a word, perfect holiness?</p>

way. These each one stood in the gap when the wrath of God broke forth, because his holiness had been insulted; and acting as intercessors, they screened the nation from the great and terrible God, who otherwise would in a dreadful manner have executed judgment in Jacob. Let these men, or such as these, lead us in our worship, and let us approach the Lord at the mercy-seat as they did, for he is as accessible to us as to them. They made it their life&#39;s business to call upon him in prayer, and by so doing brought down innumerable blessings upon themselves and others. Does not the Lord call us also to come up into the mount with Moses, and to enter the most holy place with Aaron? Do we not hear him call us by our name as he did Samuel?

Here is reason for praise, for answers to the petitions of some are proofs of God&#39;s readiness to hear others. These three men asked large things, they pleaded for a whole nation, and they stayed great plagues and turned away fiery wrath ; who would not exercise himself in adoring so great and merciful a God? If he were unholy he would be false to his word and refuse his people&#39;s cries; this, then, is recorded for our joy and for his glory, that holy men of old were not suffered to pray in vain.</span></p>

Responses came to Moses and Aaron out of that glorious overshadowing cloud, and though Samuel saw it not, yet to him also came the mystic voice which was wont to thunder forth from that divine canopy. Men have had converse with God, let men therefore speak to God in return. He has told us things to come, let us in return confess the sins which are past; he has revealed his mind to us, let us then pour out our hearts before him. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>kept </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>testimonies.&#39;&#39; </span>When others turned aside they were faithful ; in their hearts they laid up his word, and in their lives they obeyed it. When he spake to them they observed his will, and therefore when they spake to him he yielded to their desires. This keeping of the divine testimonies is a virtue all too rare in these our days; men run after their own views and opinions, and make light of the truth of God; hence it is that they fail in prayer, and scoffers have even dared to say that prayer avails not at all. May the good Lord bring back his people to reverence his word, and then will he also have respect unto the voice of their cry. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ordinance </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gave </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them.&quot; </span>His practical precept they observed as well as his doctrinal instruction. Ordinances are not to be trifled with, or testimonies will also be despised; and the converse is also true, a light estimate of inspired dogma is sure to end in neglect of moral virtues. To Moses, Aaron, and Samuel special and personal charges were committed, and they were all true to their trust, for they stood in awe of the Lord, their God, and worshipped him with their whole souls. They were very different men, and had each one a work to do peculiar to himself, yet because each was a man of prayer they were all preserved in their integrity, fulfilled their office, and blessed their generation. Lord, teach us like Moses to hold up our hands in prayer and conquer Amalek, like Aarcn to wave the censer between the living and the dead till the plague is stayed, and like Samuel to say to a guilty people, &quot;God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you;&quot; if thou wilt make us mighty with thee in prayer, we shall also be kept faithful before thee in the service which thou hast laid upon us.</p>

Of Samuel they assert that, for having set up his sons as his successors, he was compelled to submit to the anointing of Saul as king, which was a great grief to him: this is to our mind a very doubtful statement, and leads us to abandon the interpretation altogether. We believe that the passage refers to the nation which was spared through the intercession of these three holy men, but yet was severely chastened for its transgressions. In answer to the cry of Moses the tribes lived on, but the then existing generation could not enter Canaan: Aaron&#39;s golden calf was broken, though the fire of the Lord did not consume the people; and Israel smarted under the harsh government of Saul, though at Samuel&#39;s request its murmurings against the theocratic rule of their fathers&#39; God was not visited with pestilence or famine. So to forgive sin as at the same time to express abhorrence of it, is the peculiar glory of God. and is best seen in the atonement of our Lord Jesus. Reader, are you a believer? Then your sin is forgiven you ; but so surely as you are a child of God the rod of paternal discipline will be laid upon you if your walk be not close with God. &quot;You only have I known of all the nations of the earth, therefore I will punish you for your iniquities.&quot;</span></p>

and Supremacy of the Messiah, have spoken of him solely as the object of triumph and rejoicing. He has been represented in all the bounteousness of his mercy, and the excess of his lovingkindness; and the ideas of might and majesty, with which he has been accompanied, seem chiefly to have been regarded as the means by which these gracious designs will be carried into a sure effect. There is always a great danger in such a feeling, lest our <span style='font-style:italic;'>reci</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>procal </span>covenant should be too much forgotten; and we should rest on our privileges to the exclusion of our practice.

Subsequent ages have shown the existence of the same false principle amongst the Gentiles. It is a part of the weakness of human nature; and hence was the prophet inspired to warn the world of the evil, and draw their minds to a just sense of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>awfulness </span>of the Redeemer&#39;s majesty. In this view, joined as it is throughout with assertions of his readiness at all times to listen to the believer and to grant his supplication, the psalm is at once of great power and of an exceeding consolation.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hill </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tucker. </span></span></p>

Yet the Spirit of God indicates, in the covenant of grace, a threefold practical influence of his holiness upon us, of which the issue is the opposite of despair. The various steps are marked as praise, exaltation, and worship (verses 3, 5, 9). Of these the last seems by far the most difficult to realise. For it is in the nature of conscious sin to prevent even our approaches to God, to keep us from all comfortable fellowship with God, and to fill us with a heavy sense of our infinite and almost hopeless distance from him.

But withal they did sometimes some things amiss, they had some inventions, by-paths, and steps awry, which, as they needed pardon, so they occasionally incensed him so much against them that he would not let them escape altogether, without taking some vengeance for such untowardness. II. God&#39;s graciousness in a double respect: 1, in <span style='font-style:italic;'>answering </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span>granting their suits and supplications ordinarily. 2. In <span style='font-style:italic;'>forgiving </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span>pardoning their failings and faults evermore; never dealing with them altogether according to their sins, but in the midst of any offence of theirs, or judgment of his, remembeiing mercy.

Perhaps, had a profane man touched the ark, the hand of God had not so suddenly reached him. But when Uzzah, a man zealous for him, as may be supposed by his care for the support of the tottering ark, would step out of his place, he strikes him down for his disobedient action, by the side of the ark, which he would indirectly (as not being a Levite) sustain, 2 Sam. vi. 7. Nor did our Saviour so sharply reprove the Pharisees, and turn so short from them as he did from Peter, when he gave a carnal advice, and contrary to that wherein was to be the greatest manifestation of God&#39;s holiness, viz., the death of Christ, Matt, xvi. 23. He calls him Satan, a name sharper than the title of the devil&#39;s children, wherewith he marked the Pharisees, and given (besides him) to none but Judas, who made a profession of love to him, and was outwardly ranked in the number of his disciples.

Even they may have been partakers with others in their sins, or may have so provoked God themselves, and sinned in such a way as to cause his name to be blasphemed ; so that he is concerned in honour to bring some exemplary punishment upon them. So it was with David (2 Sam. xii.) : though he pardoned him as to the guilt of eternal death, saved his soul, and spared his life, which was forfeited to divine justice for the murder of Uriah ; yet the prophet announced that sharp afflictions must come on him, the sword must never &quot; depart from his house,&quot; and the child begotten in adultery must die, and his wives must be given to his neighbours. So, in Psalm xcix. 8, it seems to be spoken of Moses himself, and other godly among the Israelites who died in the wilderness, and were not permitted to come into the land of promise, that <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forgave </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them,&quot; </span>yet <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;took </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vengeance </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>inventions.&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Collins </span>(&#8212;168?) <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Morning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Exercises. </span></p>

These three persons, all eminent for their piety, were also conspicuous for having suffered the Divine displeasure on account of their failings. Moses angered the Lord at the waters of strife, and he is not suffered to enter the promised land; Aaron provoked the Divine anger by making the golden calf, and would have been destroyed, had not Moses by fervent intercession turned away the anger of the Lord lest he should destroy him ; so Samuel placed his sons over Israel, who walked not in his ways, and therefore God gave Israel a king, whose crimes caused the prophet to go down with sorrow to the grave.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Stephen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bridge, </span>1852.</p>
