Cast not away your confidence because he defers his performances. Though providences run cross, though they move backwards and forwards, you have a sure and faithful word to rely upon. Promises, though they be for a time seemingly delayed, cannot be finally frustrated. Dare not to harbour such a thought within yourselves as Psalm lxxvii. 8; &quot;Doth his promise fail for evermore?&quot; The being of God may as well fail as the promise of God. That which does not come in your time, will be hastened in his time, which is always the more convenient season. Accuse him not of slowness who hath said, &quot;I come quickly,&quot; that is, he comes as soon as all things are ready and ripe for his appearance. &#39;Tis as true that &quot; the Lord is not slack concerning &#39;his promise&quot; (2 Peter iii. 9), as that he is never guilty of breaking his promise. Wait, therefore, how long soever he tarry; do not give over expecting: the heart of God is not turned though his face be hid ; and prayers are not flung back, though they be not instantly answered.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Timothy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cruso. </span></p>

The valley of the Jordan, both in its desolation and vegetation, was one continued portent; and from its crevices ramified even into the interior of Judtea the startling appearances, if not of the volcano, at least of the earthquake. Their historical effect in the special theatres of their operation will appear as we proceed ; but their traces on the permanent feeling of the nation must be noticed here. The writings of the psalmists and prophets abound with indications which escape the eye of a superficial reader.

<span style='font-style:italic;'>Deliverance </span>being his theme, he might have taken the figure from the <span style='font-style:italic;'>peaeeable </span>phenomena of the heavens.

In order to thoroughly appreciate the beauty and truthfulness of this figure, we should endeavour to realise the full power of an Oriental storm, as it is described in Psalm xxix.

At his rebuke, and at the blast of his breath the earth recedes&#8212;the sea foams up, and its beds are seen&#8212;the land bursts, and the foundations of the world are discovered. And lo! an arm of deliverance issues forth from the black clouds, and the destructive fire grasps the wretched one who had cried out from the depths, pulls him forth, and delivers him from all his enemies I Yes, the hand of the Lord has done marvellous things in the life of David. But the <span style='font-style:italic;'>eye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fa%th </span>alone could perceive in them all the hand of God. Thousands whose experiences of the delivering hand of God are not less signal than those of David, stop short at the powers of nature, and instead of bending the knee before the All-merciful God, content themselves to express with cold hearts their admiration of the changes of the destiny of man.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Augustus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>F. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tholuck, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D.D., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ph.D.&#8212;</span>1856.</span></p>

So David, though he sinned highly and presumptuously, yet says he, &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>departed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wickedly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God;&quot; </span>that is, I have not so far departed from him as though I apprehended I should utterly lose my interest in him, yet I would go on. No; for he is my God, there lies the consideration that kept him from departing from him. So Psalm xliv. 17, &quot;We have not dealt falsely in thy covenant,&quot; says the church there. Many acts of displeasing him may pass and be ventured, but if the holy soul thinks that the covenant lay at stake, that he and God must utterly part and break off, thus far he will never go.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

Thirdly, sincerity of heart gives a man boldness even in the presence of God, notwithstanding many failings. The Lord doth &quot;charge his angels with folly,&quot; how much more man that &quot;dwells in a house of clay&quot;? Job iv. David, whose faith failed, and who had said, &quot;I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul,&quot; and whose tongue had faltered also to Abimelech, the priest; three or four several lies he had told; yet David can say to God, that he was <span style='font-style:italic;'>perfect </span>with him for all that. It is a strange boldness that the saints have in the presence of God by virtue of the new covenant. All their sins shall be laid open at the last day as a cancelled bond, that they wonder how they shall look upon them and not blush; but the same spirit of sonship that shall give them perfect boldness then, doth give them boldness in a great measure even now in this life; that they shall be able to say, &quot;Neither height nor depth,&quot; etc., nothing &quot;shall separate us from the love of Christ.&quot; &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Strong. </span></p>

There is no man but doth propend and incline more to one sin than another; as in the body there is one humour predominant, or as in the hive there is one master-bee; so in the heart there is one master-sin ; there is one sin which is not only near to a man as the garment, but dear to him as the right eye. This sin is Satan&#39;s fort-royal, all his strength lies here; and though we beat down his out-works, gross sin, yet if we let him hold this fort of complexion-sin, it is as much as he desires. The devil can hold a nIan as fast by this one link, as by a whole chain of vices. The fowler hath the bird fast enough by one wing.

Herod did many things, but there was one sin so dear to him, that he would sooner behead the prophet, than behead that sin. Herod would have a gap for his incest. An upright heart is not only angry with sin (which may admit of reconciliation), but hates sin; and if he sees this serpent creeping into his bosom, the nearer it is the more he hates it. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>WaUon. </span></span></p>

If a man cannot keep himself from sorrow, how is he able to keep himself from sin? God indeed in our first conversion works upon us as he did upon the earth, or Adam&#39;s body in paradise, before he breathed a soul into it, and made it a living creature; such a power as Christ put forth on Lazarus in his grave, for we are &quot; dead in trespasses and sins;&quot; but yet being living he must walk and act of himself, the Lord will have us to co-operate together with him, for we are built upon Christ, not as dead, but as &quot; living stones.&quot; 1 Pet. ii. 5.

The method which holy David made use of gives us the first and the best direction: and that is, by constant and fervent prayer to implore the divine aid and the continual assistance of his Holy Spirit, that God would not only keep us from falling into them, but even turn our hearts from inclining to them, and help us to see our folly and our danger. For alas! we are not able of ourselves to help ourselves, not so much as to think a good thought, much less to resist an evil inclination, or a strong temptation; but &quot;our sufficiency is of God:&quot; &quot;It is God (says the psalmist here), that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect:&quot; verse 32.

example, the more by-ends or carnal desires you had in praying, and the more you mingled of these with your holy desires, and the more want of zeal, fervency, etc., were found in your prayers, the more you shall, it may be, find of bitterness mingled with the mercy, when it is granted, and so much imperfection, and want of comfort in it.

Exod. xvii. 12. God let him see a proportion, which argued his prayer was the means of prevailing. A man finds in praying that his suit sometimes sticks, and goes not on as he expected; this is because he gives not so good a fee as he was wont, and doth not ply God and solicit him; but on the contrary, when he was stirred up to pray, then still he found things to go well. By tins a man may clearly see that it was the prayer which God did hear and regarded. Thus, likewise, when a man sees hills and dales in a business, fair hopes often, and then all dashed again, and the thing in the end brought to pass, let him look back upon his prayers. Didst not thou in like manner just thus deal with God? when thou hadst prayed earnestly, and thought thou hadst even carried it, then dash all again by interposing some sin, and thus again and again? Herein God would have you observe a proportion, and it may help you to discern how and when they are answered and obtained by prayer, because God deals thus with you therein in such a proportion to your prayers. &#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></span></p>

The class referred to are represented as reduced to a state of complete helpless subjugation. As to the event referred to, if we keep to the rendering of our translators the meaning may be, &quot;The Pagans, retired now generally to villages and remote places, shall gradually dwindle away, and fearfully anticipate the com- &#8226; plete extinction of their religion.&quot; This exactly accords with history. If with some interpreters we read, &quot;The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid because of their prisons,&quot; then the meaning may be, &quot;that they who only feigned submission, when persecution for the word should arise should openly apostatise.&quot; This, too, would be found consonant with fact.

Do you not see young heirs to great estates act and spend accordingly? And, why shall you, being the King of heaven&#39;s son, be lean and ragged from day to day, as though you were not worth a groat? O sirs, live upon your portion, chide yourselves for living besides what you have. There are great and precious promises, rich, enriching mercies; you may make use of God&#39;s all-sufficiency ; you can blame none but yourselves if you be defective or discouraged. A woman, truly godly for the main, having buried a child, and sitting alone in sadness, did yet bear up her heart with the expression, &quot;God lives;&quot; and having parted with another, still she redoubled, &quot;Comforts die, but God lives.&quot; At last her dear husband dies, and she sat oppressed and most overwhelmed with sorrow. A little child she had yet surviving, having observed what before she spoke to comfort herself, comes to her and saith, &quot; Is God dead, mother? is God dead?&quot; This reached her heart, and by God&#39;s blessing recovered her former confidence in her God, who is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>living </span>God. Thus do you chide yourselves; ask your fainting spirits under pressing outward sorrows, is not God alive? and why then doth not thy soul revive? why doth thy heart die within thee when comforts die! Cannot a living God support thy dying hopes? Thus, Christians, argue down your discouraged and disquieted spirits as David did. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Oliver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Heywood&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Sure </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mercies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>David&quot; </span>1672.</p>

wisdom, and goodness, are being sounded abroad by the heavenly heralds which shine upon us from above. He who would guess at divine sublimity should gaze upward into the starry vault; he who would imagine infinity must peer into the boundless expanse ; he who desires to see divine wisdom should consider the balancing of the orbs; he who would know divine fidelity must mark the regularity of the planetary motions; and he who would attain some conceptions of divine power, greatness, and majesty, must estimate the forces of attraction, the magnitude of the fixed stars, and the brightness of the whole celestial train.

The testimony given by the heavens is no mere hint, but a plain, unmistakeable declaration; and it is a declaration of the most constant and abiding kind. Yet for all this, to what avail is the loudest declaration to a deaf man, or the clearest showing to one spiritually blind? God^the Holy Ghost must illuminate us, or all the suns in the milky way never will.</span></p>

The expanse is full of the works of the Lord&#39;s skilful, creating hands; hands being attributed to the great creating Spirit to set forth his care and workmanlike action, and to meet the poor comprehension of mortals. It is humbling to find that even when the most devout and elevated minds are desirous to express their loftiest thoughts of God, they must use words and metaphors drawn from the earth. We are children, and must each confess, &quot;I think as a child, I speak as a child.&quot; In the expanse above us God flies, as it were, his starry flag to show that the King is at home, and hangs out his escutcheon that atheists may see how he despises their denunciations of him. He who looks up to the firmament and then writes himself down an atheist, brands himself at the same moment as an idiot or a liar. Strange is it that some who love God are yet afraid to study the God-declaring book of nature; the mock-spirituality of some believers, who are too heavenly to consider the heavens, has given colour to the vaunts of infidels that nature contradicts revelation. The wisest of men are those who with pious eagerness trace the goings forth of Jehovah as well in creation as in grace; only the foolish have any fears lest the honest study of the one should injure our faith in the other. Dr. M&#39;Cosh has well said, &quot;We have often mourned over the attempts made to set the works of God against the Word of God, and thereby excite, propagate, and perpetuate jealousies fitted to separate parties that ought to live in closest union. In particular, we have always regretted that endeavours should have been made to depreciate nature with a view of exalting revelation; it has always appeared to us to bo nothing else than the degrading of one part of God&#39;s works in the hope thereby of exalting and recommending another. Let not science and religion be reckoned as opposing citadels, frowning defiance upon each other, and their troops brandishing their armour in hostile attitude. They have too many common foes, if they would but think of it, in ignorance and prejudice, in passion and vice, under all their forms, to admit of their lawfully wasting their strength in a useless warfare with each other. Science has a foundation, and so has religion; let them unite their foundations, and the basis will be broader, and they will be two compartments of one great fabric reared to the glory of God. Let the one be the outer and the other the inner court. In the one, let all look, and admire and adore; and in the other, let those who have faith kneel, and pray, and praise. Let the one be the sanctuary where human learning may present its richest incense as an offering to God, and the other the holiest of all, separated from it by a veil now rent in twain, and in which, on a blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, we pour out the love of a reconciled heart, and hear the oracles of the living God.&quot;</p>

Oh to drink often at the celestial well, and learn to utter the glory of God! The witnesses above cannot be slain or silenced; from their elevated seats they constantly preach the knowledge of God, unawed and unbiassed by the judgments of men. Even the changes of alternating night and day aie mutely eloquent, and light and shade equally reveal the Invisible One ; let the vicissitudes of our circumstances do the same, and while we bless the God of our days of joy, let us also extol him who giveth &quot; songs in the night.&quot;</span></p>

By their line is probably meant the <span style='font-style:italic;'>measure </span>of their domain which, together with their testimony, has gone out to the utmost end of the habitable earth. No man living beneath the copes of heaven dwells beyond the bounds of the diocese of God&#39;s Courtpreachers; it is easy to escape from the light of ministers, who are as stars in the right hand of the Son of Man ; but even then men, with a conscience yet unseared, will find a Nathan to accuse them, a Jonah to warn them, and an Elijah to threaten them in the silent stars of night. To gracious souls the voices of the heavens are more influential far, they feel the sweet influences of the Pleiades, and are drawn towards their Father God by the bright bands of Orion.</p>

It rather requires a note of exclamation than of interrogation. By the law is the knowledge of sin, and in the presence of divine truth, the psalmist marvels at the number and hciuousness of his sins. He best knows himself who best knows the Word, but even such an ono will be in a maze of wonder as to what he does not know, rather than on the mount of congratulation as to what he does know. We have heard of a comedy of errors, but to a good man this is more like a tragedy. Many books have a few lines of errata at the end, but our errata might well be as large as the volume if we could but have sense enough to see them. Augustine wrote in his older days a series of Retractations ; ours might make a library if we had enough grace to be convinced of our mistakes and to confess them. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Cleanse </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>secret </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faults.&quot; </span>Thou canst mark in me faults entirely hidden from myself. It were hopeless to expect to see all my spots; therefore, O Lord, wash away in tho atoning blood even those sins which my conscience has been unable to detect. Secret sins, like private conspirators, must be hunted out, or they may do deadly mischief; it is well to be much in prayer concerning them. In the Lateran Council of the Church of Rome, a decree was passed that every true believer must confess his sins, all of them, once in a year to the priest, and they affixed to it this declaration, that there is no hope of pardon but in complying with that decree. What can equal the absurdity of such a decree as that? Do they suppose that they can tell their sins as easily as they can count their fingers? Why, if we could receive pardon for all our sins by telling every sin we have committed in one hour, there is not one of us who would be able to enter heaven, since, besides the sins that are known to us and that we may be able to confess, there are a vast mass of sins, which are as truly sins as those which we lament, but which are secret, and come not beneath our eye. If we had eyes like those of God, we should think very differently of ourselves. The transgressions which we see and confess are but like the farmer&#39;s small samples which he brings to market, when he has left his</p>

There is a natural proneness to sin in the best of men, and they must be held back as a horse is held back by the bit or they will run into it. Presumptuous sins are peculiarly dangerous. All sins are great sins, but yet some sius are greater than others. Every sin has in it the very venom of rebellion, and is full of the essential marrow of traitorous rejection of God ; but there be some sins which have in them a greater development of the essential mischief of rebellion, and which wear upon their faces more of the brazen pride which defies the Most High. It is wrong to suppose that because all sins will condemn us. that therefore one sin is not greater than another. The fact is, that while all transgression is a greatly grievous and sinful thing, yet there are some transgressions which have a deeper<a id='GBS.PA311.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.328.1.0.box.207.311.1296.670.q.60'>
shade of blackness, and a more double scarlet-dyed hue of criminality than others. The presumptuous sins of our text are the chief and worst of all sins; they rank head and foremost in the list of iniquities. It is remarkable that though an atonement was provided under the Jewish law for every kind of sin, there was this one exception: &quot;But the soul that sinneth presumptuously shall have no atonement; it shall be cut off from the midst of my people.&quot; And now under the Christian dispensation, although in the sacrifice of our blessed Lord there is a great and precious atonement for presumptuous sins, whereby sinners who have erred in this manner are made clean, yet without doubt, presumptuous sinners, dying without pardon, must expect to receive a double portion of the wrath of God, and a more terrible portion of eternal punishment in the pit that is digged for the wicked. For this reason is David so anxious that he may never come under the reigning power of these giant evils. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Then </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upright, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>innocent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>great </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>transgression.&#39;&#39; </span>He shudders at the thought of the unpardonable sin. Secret sin is a stepping-stone to presumptuous sin, and that is the vestibule of &quot; the sin which is unto death.&quot; He who is not wilful in his sin, will be in a fair way to be innocent so far as poor sinful man can be; but he who tempts the devil to tempt him is in a path which will lead him from bad to worse, and from the worse to the worst.</span></p>

The characters here are now fresh, spiritual, complete, and lively. The word of God is the singular means to know God aright. Look, as the light which comes from the sun, so that word of God, which is light, is the clearest way to know God who is light itself. Hence it is that the psalmist stands much upon this from verse 7 to verse 12, where he sets open the word in its several encomiums and operations; namely, in its perfection, its certainties, and firmness; its righteousness, and purity, and truth; and then in its efficacy&#8212;that it is a converting word, an enlightening word, an instructing word, a rejoicing word, a desirable word, a warning word, and a rewarding word.</p>

In every event they saw the agency of God ; and, therefore, they took delight in its examination. For they could not but receive pleasure from witnessing the manifestations of his wisdom and beneficence, whom they adored and loved. They had not learned, as we have in modern times, to interpose unbending laws between the Creator and his works; and then, by giving inherent power to these laws, virtually to remove God away from his creation into an ethereal extramundane sphere of repose and happiness. I do not say that this is the universal feeling of the present day. But it prevails extensively in the church, and still more in the world. The ablest philosophers of modern times do, indeed, maintain that a natural law is nothing more than the uniform mode in which God acts; and that, after all, it is not the efficiency of the law, but God&#39;s own energy, that keeps all nature in motion; that he operates immediately and directly, not remotely and indirectly, in bringing about every event, and that every natural change is as really the work of God as if the eye of sense could see his hand turning round the wheels of nature. But, although the ablest philosophy of modern times has reached this conclusion, the great mass of the community, and even of Christians, are still groping in the darkness of that mechanical system which ascribes the operations of the natural world to nature&#39;s laws instead of nature&#39;s God. By a sort of figure, indeed, it is proper, as the advocates of this system admit, to speak of God as the author of natural events, because<a id='GBS.PA314.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.331.1.0.box.251.289.1296.143.q.60'>
he originally ordained the laws of nature. But they have no idea that he exerts any direct and immediate agency in bringing them about: and, therefore, when they look upon these events they feel no impression of the presence and active agency of Jehovah.</span></p>

He compares bis own stature with the magnitude of the earth on which he dwells; the earth, with the system in which it is placed; the extent of the system, with the distance of the nearest fixed stars ; and that distance again serves as a unit of measurement for other distances which observation points out. Still no approach is made to any limit. How extended these wonderful works of the Almighty may be no man can presume to say. The sphere of creation appears to extend around us indefinitely on all sides; &quot;to have its centre everywhere, its circumference nowhere.&quot; These are considerations which from their extent almost bewilder our minds. But how should they raise our ideas toward their great Creator, when we consider that all these were created from nothing, by a word, by a mere volition of the Deity. &quot;Let them be,&quot; said God, and they were. &quot;By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.&quot; &quot;For he spake, and it was done.

Henceforth I hope to imbibe more copiously this moral emanation of the skies, when, in some such manner as the preceding, they are rationally seen, and the sight is duly improved. The stars, I trust, will teach as well as shine, and help to dispel both nature&#39;s gloom and my intellectual darkness. To some people they discharge no better a service than that of holding a flambeau to their feet, and softening the horrors of their night. To me and my friends may they act as ministers of a superior order, as counsellors of wisdom, and guides to happiness I Nor will<a id='GBS.PA315.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.332.1.0.box.1505.133.6.8.q.101'>

He is said to have been engaged upon one of his immortal works, and a lady of rank looking on remarked, &quot; But, Mr. Turner, I do not see in nature all that you describe there.&quot; &quot;Ah, Madam,&quot; answered the painter, &quot;do you not wish you could ?&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>II. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>8. </span></p>

No! I will not say <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>voice </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span>was not heard; it spoke in the very stillness as loud as in roaring thunder, in the placid scene as in rocks and cliffs impassable, and louder still in <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heaoens </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>firmament, </span>and in the magnificent prospect around me.

The relations which the gospel of Christ Jesus hath to the Psalms of David I find to be more than to all the Bible besides, that seldom anything is written in the New Testament, but we are sent to fetch our proofs from these. The margin here sends me to the Psalm, anil the Psalm sends me back to this again; showing that they both speak one thing. How comes it then that it is not one, for &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>line&quot; </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;sound&quot; </span>arc not one thing? Is there not some mistake here? Answer&#8212;To fetch a proof from a place is one thing, an allusion is another. Sometimes the evangelfsts are enforced to bring their proofs for what they write out of the Old Testament, else we should never believe them, and then they must be very sure of the terms, when they say, &quot;This was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken,&quot; etc. But the apostle was not now upon that account; only showing to the Romans the marvellous spreading of the gospel, alluding to this passage of David discoursing of &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heavens,&quot; </span>to which the prophet compared the publication of the word; the sun and moon and stars not only shining through, but round all the earth. The same &#9632; subject Paul was now upon, and for his purpose makes use of a term fitter to express the preaching of the gospel, by the word &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>sound,&quot; </span>than that other word expressing the limitations of the law, by the word &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>line:&quot; </span>both of these agreeing that there is no fitter comparison to be fetched from anything in</p>
