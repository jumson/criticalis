Certainly if they were much good they should never have them; it is an argument there is no great excellency in the strength of body, for an ox hath it more than you; an argument there is no great excellency in agility of body, for a dog hath it more than you; an argument no great excellency in gay clothes, for a peacock hath them more than you; an argument there is not any great excellency in gold and silver, for the Indians that know not God have them more than you; and if these things had any great worth in them, certainly God would never give them to wicked men&#8212;a certain argument. As it is an argument there is no great evil in affliction in this world, because that the saints are so much afflicted ; so no great argument there is any great good in this world, for the wicked they enjoy so much of it. Luther hath such an expression as this in his comment upon Genesis, saith he, &quot;The Turkish empire, as great as it is, is but a crumb, that the Master of the family, that God, casts to dogs:&quot; the whole Turkish empire, such an esteem had Luther of it; and indeed, it is no more. All the things of tho world, God in giving of them to Turks and wicked ones, his enemies, shows there is not much excellency and good in them: God therefore will cast them promiscuously up and down in the world, because he looks upon them as worthless things; God doth not so much regard whether men be prepared to give him the glory of them, yea or no, they shall have them ; however he is content to venture them. Indeed, when God comes unto his choice mercies in Christ, there he looks to have glory from them, and he doth never give them to any, but first he prepares them, that they may give him the glory of thosej mercies. But it is otherwise with others; as, suppose you see a man gathering of crabs, although swine be under the tree, he cares not much to drive them away; they are but crabs, let them have them; but if he were gathering any choice and precious fruit, if any swine should come under, he drives them away. As for outward things, crabs, the Lord suffers the swine of the world to come grunting and take them up; but when he comes to his choice mercies in his Christ, there he makes a distinction. Oh, this is precious fruit! A blacksmith that is working upon iron, though a great many cinders and little bits of iron fly up and down, he regards them not; but a goldsmith that is working upon gold, he preserves every rag, and every dust of gold ; and a lapidary that is working upon precious stones, every little bit he will be sure to preserve; a carpenter that is only hewing of timber, he regards it not much if chips fly up and down ; but it is not so with a lapidary. So these outward things are but as the chips and cinders, and such kind of things as those are, and therefore God ever gives a portion to wicked men out of them.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Jeremiah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Burroughs. </span></p>

In the New Testament you have Felix on the bench, Paul at the bar; Dives in the palace, Lazarus at his gate (Luke xvi. 19) ; he clothed in purple, Lazarus in rags and overspread with sores; he banqueted and fared deliciously every day, the other desired but the crumbs from the table, and could not have them; Dives beset with his rich and stately attendance, Lazarus hath no other society but the dogs which came to lick hi3 sores; all which Austin and Tertullian against Marcion (lib. 4), conceive to be a true history of what was really acted, though others think it parabolical.

The soul that loves God, opens itself to him, admits his influences and impressions, is easily moulded and wrought to his will, yields to the transforming power of his appearing glory. There is no resistant principle remaining when the love of God is perfected in it; and so overcoming is the first sight of his glory upon the awaking soul, that it perfects it, and so his likeness, both at once.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Howe. </span></span></p>

And yet all the joy and peace that believers are partakers of in this life is but as a drop to the ocean, as a single cluster to the whole vintage, as the thyme or honey upon the thigh of a bee to the whole hive fully fraught with it, or as the break and peep of day to the bright noontide. But yet these tastes of the water, wine, and honey of this celestial Canaan, with which the Holy Spirit makes glad the hearts of believers, are both far more desirable and satisfactory than the overflowing streams of all earthly felicities. And there are none who have once tasted of them, but say as the Samaritan woman did, &quot;Lord, give me that water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.&quot; John iv. 15. So also the first and early dawnings of the heavenly light fill the soul with more serenity, and ravish it with more pure joy, than the brightest sunshine of all worldly splendour can ever do. I have read of a devout person who but dreaming of heaven, the signatures and impressions it made upon his fancy were so strong, as that when he awaked he knew not his cell, could not distinguish the night from the day, nor difference by his taste, oil from wine ; still he was calling for his vision and saying, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Redde </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mihi </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>campos </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fioridos, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>columniim </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>auream, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comitem </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hieronyrnum, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>assistentes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>angelos</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>give me my fresh and fragrant fields again, my golden pillar of light, Jerome my companion, angels my assistants.

finishing the interior of buildings they kept the scaffolding up? The old Pope, when he had Michael Angelo employed in decorating the interior of that magnificent structure, the Sistine Chapel, demanded that the scaffolding should be taken down so that he could see the glowing colours that with matchless skill were being laid on. Patiently and assiduously did that noble artist labour, toiling by day, and almost by night, bringing out his prophets and sibyls and pictures wondrous for their beauty and significance, until the work was done. The day before it was done, if you had gone into that chapel and looked up, what would you have seen? Posts, planks, ropes, lime, mortar, slop, dirt. But when all was finished, the workmen came, and the scaffolding was removed. And then, although the floor was yet covered with rubbish and litter, when you looked up, it was as if heaven itself had been opened, and you looked into the courts of God and angeh. Now, the scaffolding is kept around men long after the fresco is commenced to be painted ; and wondrous disclosures will be made when God shall take down this scuffolding body, and reveal what you have been doing. By sorrow and by joy; by joys which are but bright colours, and by sorrows which are but shadows of bright colours; by prayer; by the influences of the sanctuary; by your pleasures; by your business; by reverses; by successes and by failures ; by what strengthened your confidence, and by what broke it down; by the things that you rejoiced in, and by the things that you mourned over&#8212;by all that God is working in you. And you are to be perfected, not according to the things that you plan, but according to the divine pattern. Your portrait and mine are being painted, and God by wondrous strokes and influences is working us up to his own ideal. Over and above what you are doing for yourself, God is working to make you like him. And the wondrous declaration is, that when you stand before God, and see what has been done for you, you shall be <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;satisfied.</span>&quot; Oh, word that has been wandering solitary and without a habitation ever since the world began, and the morning stars sang together for joy! Has there ever been a human creature that could stand on earth while clothed in the flesh, and say, &quot;I am satisfied?&quot; What is the meaning of the word? Sufficiently filled; tilled full; filled up in every part. And when God&#39;s work is complete, we shall stand before him, and, with the bright ideal and glorified conception of heavenly aspiration upon us, looking up to God, and back on ourselves, we shall say, &quot;I am satisfied ;&quot; for we shall be like him.

Why? Because that doth not satisfy a holy heart, but it is that image of the invisible God which the human nature of Jesus Christ is, who, in opposition to all these outward pleasures, will be all in all to us; he is a spiritual creature, his human nature is spiritualised, made glorious, and our bodies shall be made spiritual likewise. &quot;The body is made for the Lord, and the Lord for the body,&quot; and this when they are both raised up; Christ is raised up already, and because he hath ordained the one to be serviceable to the other, he will also raise up our bodies; and when he doth raise me up, saith David, though other men have their bellies full here, and have animal pleasures they delight in; yet when I shall awake at latter day, and shall see this image of thine, shall see thy Son, I shall be satisfied: &quot;When I awake, I shall be satisfied with thine image.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

The bodies of the righteous still sleep, but they are to be satisfied on the resurrection morn, when they awake. When a Roman conqueror had been at war, and won great victories, he would return to Rome with his soldiers, enter privately into his house, and enjoy himself till the next day, when he would go out of the city to re-enter it publicly in triumph. Now, the saints, as it were, enter privately into heaven without their bodies ; but on the last day, when their bodies wake up, they will enter into their triumphal chariots. Methinks I see that grand procession, when Jesus Christ first of all, with many crowns on his head, with his bright, glorious, immortal body, shall lead the way. Behind him come the saints, each of them clapping their hands, or pouring sweet melody from their golden harps; all entering in triumph. And when they come to heaven&#39;s gates, and the doors are opened wide to let the King of glory in, how will the angels crowd at the windows and on the housetops, like the inhabitants in the Roman triumphs, to watch the pompous procession, and scatter heaven&#39;s roses and lilies upon them, crying, &quot;Hallelujah! hallelujah! hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.&quot; &quot;I shall be satisfied &quot; in that glorious day when all the angels of God shall come to see the triumphs of Jesus, and when his people shall be victorious with him.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Spurgeon&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermons. </span></p>

If there be enough in God to satisfy the angels, then sure there is enough to satisfy us. The soul is but finite, but God is infinite. Though God be a good that satisfies, yet he does not surfeit. Fresh joys spring continually from his face; and he is as much to be desired after millions of years by glorified souls as at the first moment. There is a fulness in God that satisfies, and yet so much sweetness that the soul still desires. God is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>delicious </span>good. That which is the chief good must ravish the soul with pleasure ; there must be in it rapturous delight and quintessence of joy. <span style='font-style:italic;'>In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Deo </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>quadam </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dulcedine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deleetatur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>anima </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>immo </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ralntur</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>the love of God drops such infinite suavity into the soul as is unspeakable and full of glory.

He is better than anything you can put in competition with him; he is better than health, riches, honour. Other things maintain life, he gives life. Who would put anything in balance with the Deity? Who would weigh a feather against a mountain of gold <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>God excels all other things more infinitely than the sun the light of a taper.

The joy he gives is eternal, the crown fadeth not away. 1 Peter v. 4. The glorified soul shall be ever solacing itself in God, feasting on his love, and sunning itself in the light of his countenance. We read of the river of pleasure at God&#39;s right hand; but will not this in time be dried up? No. There is a fountain at the bottom which feeds it. Psalm xxxvi. 9. &quot;With the Lord is a fountain of life.&quot; Thus God is the chief good, and the enjoyment of God for ever is the highest felicity of which the soul is capable. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Watson. </span></span></p>

The Spirit of God was the messenger that brought him many a covered dish from God&#39;s table, inward consolations which the world knew not of. Yet David has not enough, it is heaven alone that can give him his full draught. They say the Gauls, when they first tasted of the wines of Italy, %vcre so taken with their lusciousness and sweetness, that they could not be content to trade thither for this wine, but resolved they would conquer the land where they grew. Thus the sincere soul thinks it not enough to receive a little now and then of grace and comfort from heaven, by trading and holding commerce at a distance with God in his ordinances here below, but projects and meditates a conquest of that holy land and blessed place from which such rich commodities come, that he may drink the wine of that kingdom iu that kingdom. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

It doth so more perfectly in the joyful morning of the resurrection-day when mortality is swallowed up in life, and all the yet hovering shadows of it are vanished and fled away. And how known and usual an application this is of the metaphorical terms of sleeping and awaking in Holy Writ, I need not tell them who have read the Bible. Nor doth this interpretation less fitly accord to the other contents of this verse; for to what state do the sight of God&#39;s face, and satisfaction with his likeness, so fully agree, as to that of future blessedness in the other world? But then the contexture of discourse in this and the foregoing verse together, seems plainly to determine us to this sense: for what can be more conspicuous in them, than a purposed comparison, an opposition of two states of felicity mutually to each other?

Believers are often hidden in their God from the strife of tongues and the fury of the storm of trouble. The clefts of the Rock of Ages are safe abodes. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deliverer,&quot; </span>interposing in my hour of peril. When almost captured the Lord&#39;s people are rescued from the hand of the mighty by him who is mightier still. This title of &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>deliverer&#39;&#39; </span>has many sermons in it, and is well worthy of the study of all experienced saints. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God;&quot; </span>this is all good things in one. There is a boundless wealth in this expression; it means, my perpetual, unchanging, infinite, eternal good. He who can say truly &quot; my God,&quot; may well add, &quot;my heaven, my all.&quot; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strength </span>/&quot; this word is really &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rock,&quot; </span>in the sense of strength and immobility. My sure, unchanging, eternal confidence and support. Thus the word rock occurs twice, but it is no tautology, for the first time it is a rock for concealment, but here a rock for firmness and immutability. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>In </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ill </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trust.&quot; </span>Faith must be exercised, or the preciousness of God is not truly known; and God must be the object of faith, or faith is mere presumption. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>buckler,&quot; </span>warding off the blows of my enemy, shielding me from arrow or sword.

Here are many words, but none too many; we might profitably examine each one of them had wc leisure, but summing up the whole, we may conclude with Calvin, that David here equips the faithful from head to foot.</p>

In this verse the happy poet resolves to invoke the Lord in joyful song, believing that in all future conflicts his God would deal as well with him as in the past. It is well to pray to God as to one who deserves to be praised, for then we plead in a happy and confident manner. If I feel that I can and do bless the Lord for all his past goodness, I am bold to ask great things of him. That word <span style='font-style:italic;'>So </span>has much in it. To be saved singing is to be saved indeed. Many are saved mourning and doubting; but David had such faith that he could fight singing, and win the battle with a song still upon his lips. How happy a thing to receive fresh mercy with a heart already sensible of mercy enjoyed, and to anticipate new trials with a confidence based upon past experiences of divine love!</p>

Since the breath from the nostrils is heated by strong emotion, the figure portrays the Almighty Deliverer as pouring forth smoke in the heat of his wrath and the impetuousness of his zeal. Nothing makes God so angry as an injury done to his children. He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye. God is not subject to the passions which govern his creatures, but acting as he does with all the energy and speed of one who is anery, he is here aptly set forth in poetic imagery suitable to human understandings.

Darkness is no impediment to God ; its densest gloom he makes his tent and secret pavilion. See how prayer moves earth und heaven, and raises storms to overthrow in a moment the foes of God&#39;s Israel. Things were bad for David before he prayed, but they were much worse for his foes so soon as the petition had gone up to heaven. A trustful heart, by enlisting the divine aid, turns the tables on its enemies. If I must have an enemy let him not be a man of prayer, or he will soon get the better of me by calling in his God into the quarrel.</p>

Yet the case is clear, and if the words be not strained beyond their original intention, no difficulty need occur. Albeit that the dispensations of divine grace are to the fullest degree sovereign and irrespective of human merit, yet in the dealings of Providence there is often discernible a rule of justice by which the injured are at length avenged, and the righteous ultimately delivered. David&#39;s early troubles arose from the wicked malice of envious Saul, who no doubt prosecuted his persecutions under cover of charges hrought against the character of &quot;the man after God&#39;s own heart.&quot; These charges David declares to have been<a id='GBS.PA273.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.290.1.0.box.196.310.1308.985.q.60'>
utterly false, and asserts that he possessed a grace-given righteousness whicn the Lord had graciously rewarded in defiance of all his calumniators. Before God the man after God&#39;s own heart was a humble sinner, but before his slanderers he could with unblushing face speak of the &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>cleanness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>handt&quot; </span>and the righteousness of his life. He knows little of the sanctifying power of. divine grace who is not at the bar of human equity able to plead innocence. There is no self-righteousness in an honest man knowing that he is honest, nor even in his believing that God rewards him in providence because of his honesty, for such is often a most evident matter of fact; but it would be self-righteousness indeed if we transferred such thoughts from the region of providential government into the spiritual kingdom, for there grace reigns not only supreme but sole in the distribution of divine favours. It is not at all an opposition to the doctrine of salvation by grace, and no sort of evidence of a Pharisaic spirit, when a gracious man, having been slandered, stoutly maintains his integrity, and vigorously defends his character. A godly man has a clear conscience, and knows himself to be upright; is he to deny his own consciousness, and to despise the work of the Holy Ghost, by hypocritically making himself out to be worse than he is? A godly man prizes his integrity very highly, or else he would not be a godly man at all; is he to be called proud because he will not readily lose the jewel of a reputable character? A godly man can see that in divine providence uprightness and truth are in the long run sure to bring their own reward ; may be not, when he sees that reward bestowed in his own case, praise the Lord for it <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span>Yea rather, must he not show forth the faithfulness and goodness of his God? Read the cluster of expressions in this and the following verses as the song of a good conscience, after having safely outridden a storm of obloquy, persecution, and abuse, and there will be no fear of our upbraiding the writer as one who set too high a price upon his own moral character.</span></p>

Calvin very forcibly says, &quot;This brutish and monstrous stupidity in men compels God to invent new modes of expression, and as it were to clothe himself with a different character. There is a similar sentence in Leviticus xxvi. 21&#8212;24, where God says, &quot;and if ye walk contrary unto (or perversely with) me, then will I also walk contrary unto (or perversely, or roughly, or at random with) you.&quot; As if he had said that their obstinacy and stubbornness would make him on his part forget his accustomed forbearance and gentleness, and cast himself recklessly or at random against them. We see then what the stubborn at length gain by their obduracy; it is this, that God hardens himself still more to break them in pieces, and if they are of stone, he causes them to feel that he has the hardness of iron.&quot; The Jewish tradition was that the manna tasted according to each man&#39;s mouth; certainly God shows himself to each individual according to his character.</p>

All candles ore not shining, and so there are some graces which yield no present comfort; but it is well to have candles which may by and by be lit, and it is well to possess graces which may yet afford us cheering evidences. The metaphor of the whole verse is founded upon the dolorous nature of darkness and the delightfulness of light; &quot;truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun ;&quot; and even so the presence of the Lord removes all the gloom of sorrow, and enables the believer to rejoice with exceeding great joy. The lighting of the lamp is a cheerful moment in the winter&#39;s evening, but the lifting up of the light of God&#39;s countenance is happier far. It is said that the poor in Egypt will stint themselves of bread to buy oil for the lamp, so that they may not sit in darkness; we could well afford to part with all earthly comforts if the light of God&#39;s love could but constantly gladden our souls.</span></p>

This was meant of the enemies&#39; bow, which he not only snatched from his grasp, but rendered useless by breaking it in pieces. Jesus not only destroyed the fiery suggestions of Satan, but he broke his arguments with which he shot them, by using Holy Scripture against him; by the same means we may win a like triumph, breaking the bow and cutting the spear in sunder by the sharp edge of revealed truth. Probably David had by nature a vigorous bodily frame; but it is even more likely that, like Samson, he was at times clothed with more than common strength; at any rate, he ascribes the honour of his feats entirely to his God.

Goodness is the bud of which providence is the flower; or goodness is the seed of which providence is the harvest. Some render it, &quot;thy <span style='font-style:italic;'>help,&quot; </span>which is but another word for providence; providence being the firm ally of the saints, aiding them in the service of their Lord.

It is God&#39;s making himself little which is the cause of our being made great. We are so little that if God should manifest his greatness without condescension, we should be trampled under his feet; but God, who must stoop to view the skies and bow to see what angels do, looks to the lowly and contrite,<a id='GBS.PA278.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.295.1.0.box.291.293.1294.318.q.60'>
and makes them grent. While these are the translations which have been given to the adopted text of the original, we find that there are other rendings altogether; as for instance, the Septungint, which reads, &quot;thy discipline&quot;&#8212;thy fatherly correction&#8212;&quot;hath made me great;&quot; while the Chaldce paraphrase reads, &quot; thy word hath increased me.&quot; Still the idea is the same. David ascribes all his own greatness to the condescending goodness and graciousness of his Father in heaven. Let us all feel this sentiment in our own hearts, and confess that whatever of goodness or greatness God may have put upon us, we mubt cast our crowns at his feet, and cry, &#8226;&#39; <span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gentleness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>great.&quot; </span></span></p>

That sinners perish is in itself a painful consideration, but that the Lord&#39;s law is avenged upon those who break it is to the devout mind a theme for thankfulness. We must, however, always remember that vengeance is never ours, vengeance belongeth unto the Lord, and he is so just and withal so longsuffering in the exercise of it, that we may safely leave its administration in his hands.</p>

He paints these in so lively colours, that while we read we seem to see the lightning, to hear the thunders, to feel the earthquake. He afterwards describes his victories, so that we seem to be eye-witnesses of them, and take part in them. He predicts a wide-extended empire, and concludes with a lofty expression of grateful adoration, of Jehovah,<a id='GBS.PA281.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.298.1.0.box.215.310.1305.461.q.60'>

In structure it may be so, but surely not in spirit. It appears to many besides us, one of the most magnificent lyrical raptures in the Scriptures. As if the poet had dipped his pen in &quot;the brightness of that light which was before his eye,&quot; so he describes the descending God. Perhaps it may be objected that the <span style='font-style:italic;'>nodus </span>is hardly worthy of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>vindex</span>&#8212; to deliver David from his enemies, could Deity ever be imagined to come down? But the objector knows not the character of the ancient Hebrew mind. God in its view had not to descend from heaven ; he was nigh&#8212;a cloud like a man&#39;s hand might conceal&#8212;a cry, a look might bring him down. And why should not David&#39;s fancy clothe him, as he came, in a panoply befitting his dignity, in clouds spangled with coals of fire? If he was to descend, why not in state? The proof of the grandeur of this Psalm is in the fact, that it has borne the test of almost every translation, and made doggerel erect itself, and become divine. Even Sternhold and Hopkins its fiery whirlwind lifts up, purifies, touches into true power, and then throws down, helpless and pantiug, upon their ancient common. Perhaps the great charm of the eighteenth, apart from the poetry of the descent, is the exquisite and subtle alternation of the / and the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou. </span>We have&#39;spoken of parallelism, as the key to the mechanism of Hebrew song. We find this as existing between David and God&#8212;the delivered and the deliverer&#8212; beautifully pursued throughout the whole of this Psalm. &quot;I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.&quot; &quot;I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised.&quot; &quot;He sent from above ; he took me; he drew me out of many waters.&quot; &quot;Thou wilt light my candle.&quot; &quot;Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation.&quot; &quot;Thou hast girded me with strength unto battle.&quot; &quot;Thou hast given me the necks of mine enemies.&quot; &quot;Thou hast made me the head of the heathen.&quot; It has been ingeniously argued, that the existence of the / suggests, inevitably as a polar opposite, the thought of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou, </span>that the personality of man proves thus the personality of God; but, be this as it may, David&#39;s perception of that personality is nowhere so intense as here.

Every line in this book breathes peculiar sanctity. This Psalm, though placed among the first, was penned among the last, as the preface assures us, and is left as the epitome of the general history of David&#39;s life. It is twice recorded in the Scripture (2 Sam. xxii., and in this book of Psalms), for the excellency and sweetness thereof; surely that we should take double notice of it. Holy David, being near the shore, here looks on his former dangers and deliverances with a thankful heart, and writes this Psalm to bless the Lord : as if each of you that are grown into years should review your lives and observe the wonderful goodness and providence of God towards you; and then sit down and write a modest memorial of his most remarkable mercies, for the comfort of yourselves and posterity ; an excellent practice. What a comfort would it be for you to read how good your God was<a id='GBS.PA282.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.299.1.0.box.263.284.1298.1169.q.50'>
to your father or grandfather, that are dead and gone! So would your children rejoice in the Lord upon the reading of his goodness to you; and you cannot have a better pattern for this than holy David, who wrote this Psalm when he was threescore and seven years old; when he had outlived most of his troubles, aiid almost ready for his journey to his Father in heaven, he resolves to leave this good report of him upon earth.

There are times of lifting up, as well as casting down by the hand of providence. The scene changes, the aspects of providence are very cheerful and encouraging; their winter seems to be over; they put off their garments of mourning; and then, ah, what sweet returns are made to heavenly gracious souls! Doth God lift them up by prosperity? they also will lift up their God by praises. See title, and verses 1&#8212;3 of Psalm xviii. So Moses, and the people with him (Exodus xv.), when God had delivered them from Pharaoh, how do they exalt him in a song of thanksgiving, which for the elegancy and spirituality of it, is made an emblem of the doxologies given to God in glory by the saints.

They would not care much for salvation if God were not their salvation. It more pleaseth the saints that they enjoy God, than that they enjoy salvation. False and carnal spirits will express a great deal of desire after salvation, for they like salvation, heaven, and glory well ; but they never express any longing desire after God and Jesus Christ. They love salvation, but they care not for a Saviour. Now that which faith pitoheth most upon is God himself; he shall be my salvation, let me have him, and that is salvation enough; he is my life, he is my comfort, he is my riches, he is my honour, and he is my all.

It may either be considered as equivalent to &quot;the bands by which the dead are bound.&quot; in which case, to be encircled with the bauds of death is just a figurative expression for being dead; or it may be considered as equivalent to the bands in which a person is bound in the prospect of a violent death, and by which his violent death is secured, he being prevented from escaping. It <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Iihs, </span>been supposed by some, that the allusion is to the ancient mode of hunting wild animals. A considerable tract of country was surrounded with strong ropes. The circle was gradually contracted, till the object of pursuit was so confined as to become an easy prey to the hunter. These cords were the cords of death, securing the death of the animal. The phrase is applicable to our Lord in both senses; but as &quot;the floods&quot; of wickedness, or the wicked, are represented as making him afraid subsequently to his being encircled with the cords of death, I am disposed to understand it in the latter of these two senses.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Brown. </span></p>

This image seems to have been especially familiar with the Hebrews, inasmuch as it was derived from the peculiar habit and nature of their own country. They had continually before their eyes the river Jordan, annually overflowing its banks, when at the approach of summer the snows of Libanus and the neighFoTirTng mountains melted, and, suddenly pouring down in torrents, swelled the current of the river. Besides, the whole country of Palestine, although it was not watered by many perennial streams, was, from the mountainous character of the greater part of it, liable to numerous torrents, which precipitated themselves through the narrow valleys after the periodical rainy seasons. This image, therefore, however known and adopted by other poets, may be considered as particularly familiar, and, as it were, domestic with the Hebrews; who accordingly introduce it with greater frequency and freedom.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lowth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(Bishop), </span>1710&#8212;1787.</p>
