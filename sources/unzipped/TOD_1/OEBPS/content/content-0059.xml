<a id='GBS.PA405.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.422.1.1.box.210.428.1301.1728.q.60'><span style='font-style:italic;'>Verse </span>1.&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shepherd.&quot; </span>I notice that some of the flock keep near the shepherd, and follow whithersover he goes without the least hesitation, while others stray about on either side, or loiter far behind; and he often turns round and scolds them in a sharp, stern cry, or sends a stone after them. I saw him lame one just now. Not altogether unlike the good Shepherd. Indeed, I never ride over these hills, clothed with flocks, without meditating upon this delightful theme. Our Saviour says that the good shepherd, when he putteth forth his own sheep, goeth before them, and they follow. John x. 4. This is true to the letter. They are so tame and so trained that they <span style='font-style:italic;'>follow </span>their keeper with the utmost docility. He leads them forth from the fold, or from their houses in the villages, just where he pleases. As there are many flocks in such a place as this, each one takes a different path, and it is his business to find pasture for them. It is necessary, therefore, that they should be taught to follow, and not to stray away into the unfenced fields of corn which lie so temptingly on either side. Any one that thus wanders is sure to get into trouble. The shepherd calls sharply from time to time to remind them of his presence. They know his voice, and follow on ; but, if a stranger call, they stop short, lift up their heads in alarm, and, if it is repeated, they turn and flee, because they know not the voice of a stranger. This is not the fanciful costume of a parable, it is simple fact. I have made the experiment repeatedly. The shepherd goes before, not merely to point out the way, but to see that it is practicable and safe. He is armed in order to defend his charge, and in this he is very courageous. Many adventures with wild beasts occur, not unlike that recounted by David (1 Sam. xvii. 34&#8212;36), and in these very mountains; for though there are now no lions here, there are wolves in abundance; and leopards and panthers, exceeding fierce, prowl about the wild wadies. They not unfrequently attack the flock in the very presence of the shepherd, and he must be ready to do battle at a moment&#39;s warning. I have listened with intense interest to their graphic descriptions of downright and desperate fights with these savage beasts. And when the thief and the robber come (and come they do), the faithful shepherd has often to put his life in his hand to defend his flock. I have known more than one case in which he had literally to lay it down in the contest. A poor faithful fellow last spring, between Tiberias and Tabor, instead of fleeing, actually fought three Bedawln robbers until he was hacked to pieces with their khanjars. and died among the sheep he was defending. Some sheep always keep near the shepherd, and are his special favorites. Each of them has a name, to which it answers joyfully, and the kind shepherd is ever distributing to such, choice portions which he gathers for that purpose. These are the contented and happy ones. They are in no danger of getting lost or into mischief, nor do wild beasts or thieves come near them. The great body, however, are mere worldings, intent upon their mere pleasures or selfish interests. They run from bush to bush, searching for variety or delicacies, and only now and then lift their heads to see where the shepherd is, or, rather where the general flock is, lest they get so far away as to occasion a remark in their little community, or rebuke from their keeper. Others, again, are restless and discontented, jumping into everybody&#39;s field, climbing into bushes, and even into leaning trees, whence they often fall and break their limbs. These, cost the good shepherd incessant trouble.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomson, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D.D., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>1&#39;he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ixind </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Book.&quot; </span></p>

The shepherds led their flocks forth from the gates of the city. They were in full view, and we watched them and listened to them with no little interest. Thousands of sheep and goats were there, grouped in dense, confused masses. The shepherds stood together until all came out. Then they separated, each shepherd taking a different path, and<a id='GBS.PA406.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.423.1.0.box.280.297.1299.673.q.60'>
uttering as he advanced a shrill peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed and moved, as if shaken by some internal convulsion ; then points struck out in the direction taken by the shepherds ; these became longer and longer until the confused masses were resolved into long, living streams, flowing ufter their leaders. Such a sight was not new to me, still it had lost none of its interest. It was perhaps one of the most vivid illustrations which human eyes could witness of that beautiful discourse of our Lord recorded by John, &quot;And the sheep hear the shepherd&#39;s voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers,&quot; chap. x. 3&#8212;5. The shepherds themselves had none of that peaceful and placid aspect which is generally associated with pastoral life and habits. They looked more like warriors marching to the battle-field&#8212; a long gun slung from the shoulder, a dagger and heavy pistols in the belt, a light battle-axe or ironheaded club in the hand. Such were the equipments; and their fierce flashing eyes and scowling countenances showed but too plainly that they were prepared to use their weapons at any moment.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>L. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Porter, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>A.M., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Giant </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cities </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bashan,&quot; </span>1867.</span></p>

God will see that his people shall not want; but withal, he will never engage himself to the satisfying of their corruptions, though he doth to the supply of their conditions. It is one thing what the sick man wants, another what his disease wants. Your ignorance, your discontents, your pride, your unthankful hearts, may make you to believe that you dwell in a barren land, far from mercies (as melancholy makes a person to imagine that he is drowning, or killing, etc.) ; whereas if God did open your eyes as he did Hagar&#39;s, you might see fountains and streams, mercies and blessings sufficient; though not many, yet enough, though not so rich, yet proper, and every way convenient for your good and comfort; and thus you have the genuine sense, so far as I can judge of David&#39;s assertion, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;I</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>want.&quot;--Obadiah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sedgwick. </span></p>

It requires, however, no lengthened argument to prove that he who relies on the promise of God for the supply of his temporal wants, possesses an infinitely greater security than the individual who confides in his accumulated wealth.

His struggles and his poverty were known to all; but his own declaration was, that he never wanted what was absolutely necessary. The days of his greatest straits were the days of his most signal and timely deliverances. When old age benumbed the hand of his industry, the Lord extended to him the hand of charity. And often has he gone forth from his scanty breakfast, not knowing from what earthly source his next meal was to be obtained. But yet with David he could rely on his Shepherd&#39;s care, and say, &quot;I shall not want;&quot; and as certainly as he trusted in God, so surely, in some unexpected manner was his necessity supplied.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stevenson. </span></p>

Yon shepherd is about to lead his flock across ; and as our Lord says of the good shepherd&#8212;you observe that he goes before, and the sheep follow. Not all in the same manner, however. Some enter boldly, and come straight across. These are the loved ones of the flock, who keep hard by yie footsteps of the shepherd, whether sauntering through green meadows by the still waters, feeding upon the mountains, or resting at noon beneath the shadow of great rocks. And now others enter, but in doubt and alarm. Far from their guide, they miss the ford, and are carried down the river, some more, some less; and yet, one by one, they all struggle over and make good their landing. Notice those little lambs. They refuse to enter, and must be driven into the stream by the shepherd&#39;s dog, mentioned by Job in his &quot;parable.&quot; Poor things! how they leap, and plunge, and bleat in terror! That weak one yonder will be swept quite away, and perish in the sea. But no ; the shepherd himself leaps into the stream, lifts it into his bosom, and bears it trembling to the shore. All safely over, how happy they appear! The lambs frisk and gambol about in high spirits, while the older ones gather round their faithful guide, and look up to him in subdued but expressive thankfulness. Now, can you watch such a scene, and not think of that Shepherd who leadeth Joseph like a flock ; and of another river, which all his sheep must cross? He, too, goes before, and, as in the case of this flock, they who keep near him &quot; fear no evil.&quot; They hear his sweet voice, saying, &quot;When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.&quot; Isaiah xliii. 2. With eye fastened on him, they scarcely see the stream, or feel its cold and threatening waves.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomson. </span></p>

in the best colour. A meat though never so good, yet if it look not handsomely, it dulls the appetite; but when besides the goodness, it hath also a good look, this gives the appetite another edge, and makes a joy before enjoying. But yet the goodness is not altogether in the greenness. Alas! green is but a colour, and colours are but deceitful things; they might be green leaves, or they might be green flags or rushes; and what good were to me in such a greenness? No, my soul; the goodness is in being &quot;green <span style='font-style:italic;'>pastures,&quot; </span>for now they perform as much as they promise ; and as in being <span style='font-style:italic;'>green </span>they were a comfort to ine as soon as I saw them, so in being green &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>pastures&quot; </span>they are a refreshing to me now as soon as I taste them. As they arc pleasant to look on, so they are wholesome to feed on: as they are sweet to be tasted, so they arc easy to be digested ; that I am now, methinks, in a kind of paradise and seem not to want anything, unless perhaps a little water with which now and then to wash my mouth, at most to take sometimes a sip: for though sheep be no great drinkers, and though their pastures being green, and full of sap, make drink the less needful ; yet some drink they must have besides. And now see the great goodness of this Shepherd, and what just cause there is to depend upon his providence; for he lets not his sheep want this neither, but &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>leadeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bes&#39;uies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>still </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>waters,&quot; </span>not waters, that roar and make a noise, enough to fright a fearful sheep, but waters &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>still</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot; </span>and quiet; that though they drink but little, yet they may drink that little without fear. And may I not justly say now, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The&#39;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Shepherd</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>want&quot;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>? </span>And yet perhaps there will be <span style='font-style:italic;'>want </span>for all this; for 1s it enough that he lead them into green pastures and beside still waters? May he not lead them in, and presently take them out again before their bellies be half full; and so instead of making them happy, make them more miserable? set them in a longing with the sight, and then frustrate them of their expectation? No, my soul; the measure of this Shepherd&#39;s goodness is more than so.

Though he should level his fatal arrows at the little circle of my associates, and put lover and friend far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness, I will fear no evil. Yea, though I myself should feel his arrow sticking fast in me, the poison drinking up my spirits; though I should in consequence of that fatal seizure, sicken and languish, and have all the symptoms of approaching dissolution, still I will fear no evil. Nature, indeed, may start back and tremble, but I trust that he who knows the flesh to be weak, will pity and pardon these struggles. However I may be afraid of the agonies of dying, I will fear no evil in death. The venom of his sting is taken away. The point of his arrow is blunted, so that it can pierce no deeper than the body. My soul is invulnerable. I can smile at the shaking of his spear; look unmoved on the ravages which the tinrelenting destroyer is making on my tabernacle; and long for the happy period when he shall have made a breach wide enough for my heaven-aspiring spirit to fly away and be at rest.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lMvington. </span></p>

You think they cannot be merry when their countenance is so grave; but they are sure you cannot be truly merry when you smile with a curse upon your souls. They know that he spoke that sentence which could not be mistaken, &quot;Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful ; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.&quot; Prov. xiv. 13. Then call your roaring, and your singing, and laughter, mirth; but the Spirit of God calls it madness. Eccl. ii. 2. When a carnal man&#39;s heart is ready to die within him, and, with Nabal, to become like a stone, how cheerfully then can those look that have God for their friend! Which of the valiant ones of the world can outface death, look joyfully into eternity? Which of them can hug a fagot, embrace the flames? This the saint can do, and more<sup>&#39;</sup> too; for he can look infinite justice in the face with a cheerful heart; he can hear of hell with joy and thankfulness; he can think of the day of judgment with great delight and comfort. I again challenge all the world to produce one out of all their merry companies, one that can do all this. Come, muster up all your jovial blades together; call for your harps and viols; add what you will to make the concert complete; bring in your richest wines; come, lay your heads together, and study what may still add to your comfort. Well, is it done? Now, come away, sinner, this night thy soul must appear before God. Well now, what say you, man? What! doth your courage fail you? Now call for your merry companions, and let them cheer thy heart. Now call for a cup, a whore; never be daunted, man. Shall one of thy courage quail, that could make a mock at the threatenings of the Almighty God? What, so boon and jolly but now, and now down in the mouth! Here&#39;s a sudden change indeed! Where are thy merry companions, I say again? All fled? Where are thy darling pleasures? Have all forsaken thee? Why shouldst thou be dejected; there&#39;s a poor man in rags that&#39;s smiling? What! art thou quite bereft of all comfort? What&#39;s the matter, man? What&#39;s the matter? There&#39;s a question with all my heart, to ask a man that must appear before God to-morrow morning. Well, then, it seems your heart misgives you. What then did you mean to talk of joys and pleasures? Are they all come to this? Why, there stands one that now hath his heart as full of comfort as ever it can hold, and the very thoughts of eternity, which do so daunt your soul, raise his! And would you know the reason? He knows he is going to his Friend; nay, his Friend bears him company through that dirty lane. Behold how good and how pleasant a thing it is for God and the soul to dwell together in unity! This it is to have God for a friend. &quot;Oh, blessed is the soul that is in such a case; yea, blessed is the soul whose God is the Lord.&quot; Psa. cxliv. 15.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Janeway. </span></p>

The Christian, that hath this preparation of heart, never tastes more sweetness in the enjoyments of this life, than when he dips these morsels in the meditation of death and eternity. It is no more grief to his heart to think of the remove of these, which makes way for those far sweeter enjoyments, than it would be to one at a feast, to have the first course taken off, when he hath fed well on it, that the second course of all rare sweetmeats and banqueting stuff may come on, which it cannot till the other be gone. Holy David, in this place, brings in, as it were, a death&#39;s head with his feast. In the same breath almost, he speaks of his dying (verse 4), and of the rich feast he at present sat at through the bounty of God (verse 5), to which he was not so tied by the teeth, but if God, that gave him this cheer, should call him from it, to look death in the face, he could do it, and <span style='font-style:italic;'>fear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evil </span>when <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>valley </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shadow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it. </span>And what think you of the blessed apostle Peter?

How very different is this from the ignorant Jewish notion of God which prevailed in our Saviour&#39;s day ?. The Jews said, &quot;The holy land is God&#39;s, and the seed of Abraham are his only people;&quot; but their great Monarch had long before instructed them,&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord&#39;s, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fulness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thereof.&#39;&#39; </span>The whole round .world is claimed for Jehovah,&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dwell </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>therein&quot; </span>are declared to be his subjects. When we consider the bigotry of the Jewish people at the time of Christ, and how angry they were with our Lord for saying that many widows were in Israel, but unto none of them was the prophet sent, save only to the widow of Sarepta, and that there were many lepers in Israel, but none of them was healed except Naaman the Syrian,&#8212;when we recollect, too, how angry they were at the mention of Paul&#39;s being sent to the Gentiles, we are amazed that they should have remained in such blindness, and yet have sung this psalm, which shows so clearly that God is not the God of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also. What a rebuke is this to those wiseacres who speak of the negro and other despised races as though they were not caved for by the God of heaven! If a man be but a man the Lord claims him, and who dares to brand him as a mere piece of merchandise! The meanest of men is a dweller in the world, and therefore belongs to Jehovah. Jesus Christ has made an end of the exclusiveness of nationalities. There is neither barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but we all are one in Christ Jesus.</p>

The great Landowner and true Proprietor holds his court above the clouds, and laughs at the title-deeds of worms of the dust.

living creatures make upon its stores. The sea is full, despite all the clouds which rise from it; the air is full, notwithstanding all the lives which breathe it; the soil is full, though millions of plants derive their nourishment from it. Under man&#39;s tutored hand the world is coming to a greater fulness than ever, but_it is all the Lord&#39;s ; the field and the fruit, the earth and all earth&#39;s wonders are Jehovah&#39;s. We look also for a sublimer fulness when the true ideal of a world for God shall have been reached in millennial glories, and then most clearly the earth will be the Lord&#39;s and the fulness thereof. These words are now upon London&#39;s Royal Exchange, they shall one day be written in letters of light across the sky.</span></p>

He who rules the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air should not be disobeyed by man, his noblest creature. Jehovah is the Universal King, all nations are beneath his sway: true Autocrat of all the nations, emperors and czars are but his slaves. Men are not their own, nor may they call their lips, their hearts, or their substance their own; they are Jehovah&#39;s rightful servants. This claim especially applies to us who are born from heaven. We do not belong to the world or to Satan, but by creation and redemption we are the peculiar portion of the Lord.</p>

Let it be noted, however, upon what insecure foundations all terrestrial things are founded. Founded on the seas! Established 011 the floods! Blessed be God the Christian has another world to look forward to, and rests his hopes upon a more stable foundation than this poor world affords. They who trust in worldly things build upon the sea; but we have laid our hopes, by God&#39;s grace, upon the Kock of Ages; we are resting upon the promise of an immutable God, we are depending upon the constancy of a faithful Redeemer. Oh! ye worldlings, who have built your castles of confidence, your palaces of wealth, and your bowers of pleasure upon the seas, and established them upon the floods; how soon will your baseless fabrics melt, like foam upon the waters! Sand is treacherous enough, but what shall be said of the yet&#8226;more unstable seas?</p>

In heaven he reigns most gloriously, who shall be permitted to enter into his royal presence? God has mude all, but he will not save all ; there is a chosen company who shall have the singular honour of dwelling with him in his high abode. These choice spirits desire to commune with God, and their wish shall be granted them. The solemn enquiry of the text is repeated in another form. Who shall be able to &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>stand </span>&quot; or continue there? He casteth away the wicked, who then can abide in his house? Who is he that can gaze upon the Holy One, and can abide in the blaze of his glory? Certainly none may venture to commune with God upon the footing of the law, but grace can make us meet to behold the vision of the divine presence. The question before us is one which all should ask for themselves, and none should be at ease till they receive an answer of peace. With careful selfexamination let us enquire, &quot;Lord, is it I?&quot;</p>

To wash in water with Pilate is nothing, but to wash in innocency is all-important. It is to be feared that many professors have perverted the doctrine of justification by faith in such a way as to treat good works with contempt; if so, they will receive everlasting contempt at the last great day. It is vain to prate of inward experience unless the daily life is free from impurity, dishonesty, violence, and oppression. Those who draw near to God must have &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>clean </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands.&quot; </span>What monarch would have servants with filthy hands to wait at his table? They who were ceremonially unclean could not enter into the Lord&#39;s house which was made with hands, much less shall the morally defiled be allowed to enjoy spiritual fellowship with a holy God. If our hands are now unclean, let us wash them in Jesu&#39;s precious blood, and so let us pray unto God, lifting up pure hands. But &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>clean </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands </span>&quot; would not suffice, unless they were connected with &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pure </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&#39;&#39; </span>True religion is heart-work. We may wash the outside of the cup and the platter as long as we please, but if the inward parts be filthy, we are filthy altogether in the sight of God, for our hearts are more truly ourselves than our hands are. We may lose our hands and yet live, but we could not lose our heart and still live ; the very life of our being lies in the inner nature, and hence the imperative need of purity within. There must be a work of grace in the core of the heart as well as in the palm of the hand, or our religion is a delusion. May God grant that our inward powers may be cleansed by the sanctifying Spirit, so that we may love holiness and abhor all sin. The pure in heart shall see God, all others are but blind bats; stone-blindness in the eyes arises from stone in the heart. Dirt in the heart throws dust in the eyes.</p>

It must not be supposed that the persons who are thus described by their inward and outward holiness are saved by the merit of their works; but their works arc the evidences by which they are known. The present verse shows that in the saints grace reigns and grace alone. Such men wear the holy livery of the Great King because he has of his own free love clothed them therewith. The true saint wears the wedding garment, but he owns that the Lord of the feast provided it for him, without money and without price. <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&quot;</sup></span><span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>receive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bless</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteousness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation.&quot; </span>So that the saints need salvation; they receive righteousness, and &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blessing&quot; </span>is a boon from God their Saviour. They do not ascend the hill of the Lord as givers but as receivers, and they do not wear their own merits, but a righteousness which they have received. Holy living ensures a blessing as its reward from the thrice Holy God, but it is itself a blessing of the New Covenant and a delightful fruit of the Spirit. God first gives us good works, and then rewards us for them. Grace is not obscured by God&#39;s demand for holiness, but is highly exalted as we see it decking the saint with jewels, and clothing him in fair white linen ; all this sumptuous array being a free gift of mercy.</p>

Even <span style='font-style:italic;'>seeking </span>has a sanctifying influence; what a consecrating power must lie in finding and enjoying the Lord&#39;s face and favour! To desire communion with God is a purifying thing. Oh to hunger and thirst more and more after a clear vision of the face of God; this will lead us to purge ourselves from all filthiness, and to walk with heavenly circumspection. He who longs to see his friend when he passes takes care to clear the mist from the window, lest by any means his friend should go by unobserved. Really awakened souls seek the Lord above everything, and as this is not the usual desire of mankind, they constitute a generation by themselves; a people despised of men but beloved of God. The expression &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jacob&quot; </span>is a very difficult one, unless it be indeed true that the God of Jacob here condescends to be called Jacob, and takes upon himself the name of his chosen people.</p>

To comprehend it fully, it should be understood that Jerusalem, as the city of God, was by the Jews regarded as a type of heaven.

The court of the tabernacle was the &#8226;scene of the Lord&#39;s more immediate residence&#8212;the tabernacle his palace, and the ark his throne. With this leading idea in his mind, the most cursory reader &#8212;if there be cursory readers of the Bible&#8212;cannot fail to be struck with the beauty and sublimity of this composition, and its exquisite suitableness to the occasion.

Seeing the compass of the world and all they that dwell therein are the Lord&#39;s, it is plain that the church is not confined within the limits of one region, or glued, as it were, to one scat only. The Donatists in old time, would tie the church only to Cartenna in Africa, the Papists in our time to Rome in Italy; but the Scriptures plainly affirm that the golden candlesticks are removed from one place to another, and that the kingdom of God is taken away from one nation and given unto another country that brings forth the fruit thereof; in every region he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.
