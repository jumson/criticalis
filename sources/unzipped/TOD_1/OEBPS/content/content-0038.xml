So is the truth of God ; there is scarce any truth but hath been tried over and over again, and still if any dross happen to mingle with it, then God calls it in question again. If in former times there have been Scriptures alleged that have not been pertinent to prove it, that truth shall into the fire again, that what is dross may be burnt up; the Holy Ghost is so curious, so delicate, so exact, he cannot bear that falsehood should be mingled with the truths of the gospel. That is the reason, therefore, why that God doth still, age after age, call former things in question, because that there is still some dross one way or other mingled with them; either in the stating the opinions themselves, or else in the Scriptures that are brought and alleged for them, that have passed for current, for he will never leave till he have purified them. The doctrine of God&#39;s free grace hath been tried over, and over, and over again. Pelagius begins, and he mingles his dross with it: he saith, grace is nothing but nature in man. Well, his doctrine was purified, and a great deal of dross purged out. Then come the &#39;semi-Pelagians, and they part stakes; they say, nature can do nothing without grace, but they make nature to concur with grace, and to have an influence as well as grace ; and the dross of that was burnt up. The Papists, they take up the same quarrel, but will neither be Pelagians nor semi-Pelagians, yet still mingle dross. The Arminians, they come, and they refine popery in that point anew; still they mingle dross. God will have this truth tried seven times in the fire, till he hath brought it forth as pure as pure may be. And I say it is because that truth is thus precious. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

We set up monumental stones over the graves of our joys, but who thinks of erecting monuments of praise for mercies received?

Perhaps, too, here is an allusion to that cheering of the spirits so frequently called the enlightening of the eyes because it causes the face to brighten, and the eyes to sparkle. Well may we use the prayer, &quot;Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord!&quot; for in many respects we need the Holy Spirit&#39;s illuminating rays. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Lest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sleep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sleep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>death.&quot; </span>Darkness engenders sleep, and despondency is not slow in making the eyes heavy. From this faintnest and dimness of vision, caused by despair, there is but a step to the iron sleep of death. David feared that his trials would end his life, and he rightly uses his fear as an argument with God in prayer; for deep distress has in it a kind of claim upon compassion, not a claim of right, but a plea which has power with grace. Under the pressure of heart sorrow, the psalmist does not look forward to the sleep of death with hope and joy, as assured believers do, but he shrinks from it with dread, from which we gather that bondage from fear of death is no new thing.</p>

He begins many of his psalms sighing, and ends them singing; and others he begins in joy and ends in sorrow; &quot;so that one would think,&quot; says Peter Moulin, &quot;that those Psalms had been composed by two men of a contrary humour.&quot; It is worthy to be observed that the joy is all the greater because of the previous sorrow, as calm is all the more delightful in recollection of the preceding tempest.</p>

He is sure of his faith, and his faith makes him sure ; had he doubted the reality of his trust in God, he would have blocked up one of the windows through which the sun of heaven delights to shine. Faith is now in exercise, and consequently is readily discovered ; there is never a doubt in our heart about the existence of faith while it is in action : when the hare or partridge is quiet we see it not, but let the same be in motion and we soon perceive it. All the powers of his enemies had not driven the psalmist from his stronghold.

If I knew that the Beloved were only gone away for trial, and further humiliation, and not smoked out of the house with new provocations, I would forgive desertions and hold my peace at his absence. But Christ&#39;s bought absence (that I bought with my sin), is two running boils at once, one upon each side; and what side then can I lie on? 3. I know that, as night and shadows are good for flowers, and moonlight and dews are better than a continual sun, so is Christ&#39;s absence of special use, and that it hath some nourishing virtue in it, and giveth sap to humility, and putteth an edge on hunger, and furnisheth a fair field to faith to put forth itself, and to exercise its fingers in gripping it seeth not what.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Rutherford, </span>1600-&#8212; 1661.</p>

Now, as exercise brings benefit to the body, so does prayer to the soul. Exercise doth help to digest or breathe forth those humours that clog the spirits. One that stirs little we see grow pursy, and is soon choked up with phlegm, which exercise clears the body of. Prayer is the saint&#39;s exercise-field, where his graces are breathed ; it is as the wind to the air, it brightens the soul ; as bellows to the fire, which clears the coal of those ashes that smother them. The Christian, while in this world, lives in an unwholesome climate; one while, the delights of it deaden and dull his love to Christ another while, the trouble he meets in it damps his faith on the promise. How now should the Christian get out of these distempers, had he not a throne of grace to resort to, where, if once his soul be in a melting frame, he (like one laid in a kindly sweat), soon breathes out the malignity of his disease, and comes into his right temper again? How often do we find the holy prophet, when he first kneels down to pray, full of fears and doubts, who, before he and the duty part, grows into a sweet familiarity with God, and repose in his own spirit! (Psalm xiii. 1), he begins his prayer as if he thought God would never give him a kind look more: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>How </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>long </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wilt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forget </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>O </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord? </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever?&quot; </span>But by that time he had exercised himself a little in duty, his distemper wears off, the mists scatter, and his faith breaks out as the sun in its strength, verses 5, 6: <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&quot;</sup></span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trusted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoice </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>Thus his faith lays the cloth, expecting a feast ere long to be set on : he that now questioned whether he should ever hear good news from heaven, is so strong in faith as to make himself merry with the hopes of that mercy which he is assured will come at last.

He seems to have been in great distress; and, as is common in such cases, his thoughts turned inward, casting in his mind what he should do, and what would be the end of things. While thus exercised, he had <span style='font-style:italic;'>sorrow </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>daily</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>but, betaking himself to God for relief, he succeeded, <span style='font-style:italic;'>trusting </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoiced </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation. </span>There are many persons, who, when in trouble, imitate David in the former part of this experience: I wish we may imitate him in the latter.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Andrew </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Fuller. </span></p>

It is some relief when others, though they cannot help us, yet seem to be truly concerned for the sadness of our case; when by the kindness of their words and of their actions they do a little smooth the wounds they cannot heal; but &#39;tis an unspeakable addition to the cross, when a man is brought low under the sense of God&#39;s displeasure, to have men to mock at his calamity, or to revile him, or to speak roughly; this does inflame and exasperate the wound that was big enough before; and it is a hard thing when one has a dreadful sound in his ears to have every friend to become a son of thunder. It is a small matter for people that are at ease, to deal severely with such as are afflicted, but they little know how their severe speeches and their angry words pierce them to the very soul. &#39;Tis easy to blame others for complaining, but if such had felt but for a little while what it is to be under the fear of God&#39;s anger, they would find that they could not but complain. It cannot but make any person restless and uneasy when he apprehends that God is his enemy. It is no wonder if he makes every one that he sees, and every place that he is in, a witness of his grief; but now it is a comfort in our temptations and in our fears, that we have so compassionate a friend as Christ is to whom we may repair, &quot;For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.&quot; Heb. iv. 15.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Timothy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sogers. </span></p>

Nor do they less significantly describe the restoration of the soul to a state of spiritual health and holy joy, which will manifest themselves in like manner, by &quot; the eyes of the understanding being enlightened ;&quot; and in this case, the soul is saved from the sleep of sin, as the body is in the other, from the sleep of death.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Horne. </span></p>

Mr. Philpot answered, &quot;My lord, the mirth which we make is but in singing certain Psalms, as we are&#9632; commanded by Paul, to rejoice in the Lord, singing together hymns and Psalms, for we are in a dark, comfortless place, and therefore, we thus solace ourselves. I trust, therefore, your lordship will not be angry, seeing the apostle saith, &#39;If any be of an upright heart, let him sing Psalms;&#39; and we, to declare that we are of an upright mind to God, though we are in misery, yet refresh ourselves with such singing.&quot; After some other discourse, saith he, &quot;I was carried back to my lord&#39;s coal-house, where I, with my six fellow prisoners, do rouze together in the straw, as cheerfully (I thank God) as others do in their beds of down.&quot; And in a letter to a friend, he thus writes: &quot;Commend me to Mr. Elsing and his wife, and thank them for providing me some ease in my prison ; and tell them that though my lord&#39;s coal-house be very black, yet it is more to be desired of the faithful than the Queen&#39;s palace. The world wonders how we can be so merry under such extreme miseries; but our God is omnipotent, who turns misery into felicity. Believe me, there is no such joy in the world, as the people of God have under the cross of Christ: I speak by experience, and therefore believe me, and fear nothing that the world can do unto you, for when they imprison our bodies, they set our souls at liberty to converse with God ; when they cast us down, they lift us up; when they kill us, then do they send us to everlasting life. What greater glory can there be than to be made conformable to our Head, Christ? And this is done by affliction. O good God, what am I, upon whom thou shouldst bestow so great a mercy? This is the day which the Lord hath made ; let us rejoice and be glad in it. This is the way, though it be narrow, which is full of the peace of God, and leadeth to eternal bliss. Oh, how my heart leapeth for joy that I am so near the apprehension thereof! God forgive me my unthankfulness, and unworthiness of so great glory. I have so much joy, that though I be in a place of darkness and mourning, yet I cannot lament ; but both night and day</p>

He would not deny God if he were not a fool by nature, and having denied God it is no marvel that he becomes a fool in practice. Sin is always folly, and as it is the height of sin to attack the very existence of the Most High, so is it also the greatest imaginable folly. To say there is no God is to belie the plainest evidence, which is obstinacy; to oppose the common consent of mankind, which is stupidity; to stifle consciousness, which is madness.

Had he hardly become audacious enough to &#8226;utter his folly with his tongue? Did the Lord look upon his thoughts as being in the nature of words to liim though not to man? Is this where man first becomes an unbeliever?&#8212;in his heart, not in his head? And when he talks atheistically, is it a foolish heart speaking, and endeavouring to clamour down the voice of conscience? We think so. If the affections were set upon truth and righteousness, the understanding would have no difficulty in settling the question of a present personal Deity, but as the heart dislikes the good and the right, it is no wonder that it desires to be rid of that Elohim, who is the great moral Governor, the Patron of rectitude and the Punisher of iniquity. While men&#39;s hearts remain what they are, we must not be surprised at the prevalence of scepticism; a corrupt tree will bring forth corrupt fruit. &quot;Every man,&quot; says Dickson, &quot;so long as he lieth unrenewed and unreconciled to God is nothing in effect but a madman.&quot; What wonder then if he raves? Such fools as those we are now dealing with are common to all time, and all countries; they grow without watering, and are found all the world over. The spread of mere intellectual enlightenment will not diminish their number, for since it is an affair of the heart, this folly and great learning will often dwell together. To answer sceptical cavillings will be labour lost until grace enters to make the mind willing to believe; fools can raise more objections in an hour than wise men can answer in seven years, indeed it is their mirth to set stools for wise men to stumble over. Let the preacher aim at the heart, and preach the all-conquering love of Jesus, and he will by God&#39;s grace win more doubters to the faith of the gospel than any hundred of the best reasoners who only direct their arguments to the head.</p>

Calvin seems to regard this saying &quot; no God,&quot; as hardly amounting to a syllogism, scarcely reaching to a positive, dogmatical declaration ; but Dr. Alexander clearly shows that it does. It is not merely the wish of the sinner&#39;s corrupt nature, and the hope of his rebellious heart, but he manages after a fashion to bring himself to assert it, and at certain seasons he thinks that he believes it. It is a solemn reflection that some who worship God with their lips may in their hearts be saying, &quot; no God.&quot; It is worthy of observation that he does not say there is no Jehovah, but there is no Elohim; Deity in the abstract is not so much the object of attack, as the covenant, personal, ruling and governing presence of God in the world. God as ruler, lawgiver, worker, Saviour, is the butt at which the arrows of human wrath are shot. How impotent the malice! How mad the rage which raves and foams against Him in whom we live and move and have our being! How horrible the insanity which leads a man who owes his all to God to cry out,&#39;&#39; <span style='font-style:italic;'>No </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God&#39;</span>&#39; / How terrible the depravity which makes the whole race adopt this as their hearts&#39; desire, &quot; no God!&quot;</p>

The words are rendered by eminent crities in an active sense, &quot;they have done corruptly:&quot; this may serve to remind us that sin is not only in our nature passively as&quot;the source of evil, but we ourselves actively fan the flame and corrupt ourselves, making that blacker still which was black as darkness itself already. We rivet our own chains by habit and continuance.</p>

The case of Sodom, visited before it was overthrown, illustrates the careful manner in which Divine Justice beholds the sin before it avenges it, and searches out the righteous that they perish not with the guilty.

The objects of the Lord&#39;s search are not wealthy men, great men, or learned men; these, with all they can offer, cannot meet the demands of the great Governor: at the same time, he is not looking for superlative eminence in virtue, he seeks for <span style='font-style:italic;'>any </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#8226;understand </span>themselves, their state, their duty, their destiny, their happiness; he looks for any that <span style='font-style:italic;'>seek </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God, </span>who, if there be a God, are willing and anxious to find him out. Surely this is not too great a matter to expect; for if men have not yet known God, if they have any right understanding, they will seek him. Alas ! even this low degree of good is not to be found even by him who sees all things: but men love the hideous negation of &quot;No God,&quot; and with their hacks to their Creator, who is the sun of their life, they journey into the dreary region of unbelief and alienation, which is a land of darkness as darkness itself, and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darkness.</p>

Men who having no saving knowledge of divine things, enslave themselves to become workers of iniquity, have no heart to cry to the Lord for deliverance, but seek to amuse themselves with devouring the poor and despised people of God. It is hard bondage to be a &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>uorker </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iniquity</span>/&#39; &#39; a worker at the galleys, or in the mines of Siberia, is not more truly degraded and wretched; the toil is hard and the reward dreadful ; those who have no knowledge choose such slavery, but those who are taught of God cry to be rescued from it. The same ignorance which keeps men bondsmen to evil, makes them hate the freeborn sons of God; hence they seek to eat them up &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eat </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bread,&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212;daily, ravenously, as though it were an ordinary, usual, every-day matter to oppress the saints of God. As pikes in a pond eat up little fish, as eagles prey on smaller birds, as wolves rend the sheep of the pasture, so sinners naturally and as a matter of course, persecute, malign, and mock the followers of the Lord Jesus. While thus preying, they forswear all praying, and in this act consistently, for how could they hope to be heard while their hands are full of blood?</p>

The ghost of past sin is a terrible spectre to haunt any man, and though unbelievers may boast as loudly as they will, a sound is in their ears which makes them ill at ease.</p>

Shut their eyes as they may, they cannot but perceive the image of God in the character of his truly gracious people, nor can they fail to see that he works for their deliverance. Like Haman, they instinctively feel a trembling when they see God&#39;s Mordecais. Even though the saint may be in a mean position, mourning at the gate where the persecutor rejoices in state, the sinner feels the influence of the believer&#39;s true nobility and quails before it, for God is there. Lot scoffers beware, for they persecute the Lord Jesus when they molest his people ; the union is very close between God and his people, it amounts to a mysterious indwelling, for God is in the generation of the righteous.</p>

Of all folly, that is the greatest, which relates to eternal objects, because it is the most fatal, and when persisted in through life, entirely remediless. A mistake in the management of temporal concerns may be afterwards rectified. At any rate, it is comparatively of little importance. But an error in spiritual and eternal matters, as it is in itself of the greatest moment, if carried through life, can never be remedied; because after death there is no redemption. The greatest folly that any creature is capable of, is that of denying or entertaining unjust apprehensions of the being and perfections of the great Creator.

On the contrary, there is not a more ridiculous animal than an atheist in his retirement. His mind is incapable of rapture or elevation: he can only consider himself as an insignificant figure in a landscape, and wandering up and down in a field or a meadow, under the same terms as the meanest animals about him, and as subject to as total a mortality as they, with this aggravation, that he is the only one amongst them who lies under the apprehension of it. In distresses he must be of all creatures the most helpless and forlorn; he feels the whole pressure of a present calamity, without being relieved by the memory of anything that is past, or the prospect of anything that is to come. Annihilation is the greatest blessing that he proposes to himself, and a halter or a pistol the only refuge he can fly to. But if you would behold one of these gloomy miscreants in his poorest figure, you must consider him under the terrors or at the approach of death. About thirty years ago, I was a shipboard with one of these vermin, when there arose a brisk gale, which could frighten nobody but himself. Upon the rolling of the ship he fell upon his knees, and confessed to the chaplain, that he had been a vile atheist, and had denied a Supreme Being ever since he came to his estate. The good man was astonished, and a report immediately ran through the ship, that there was an atheist upon the upper deck. Several of the common seamen, who had never heard the word before, thought it had been some strange fish ; but they were more surprised when they saw it was a man, and heard out of his own mouth, &quot;That he never believed till that day that there was a God.&quot; As he lay in the agonies of confession, one of the honest tars whispered to the boatswain, &quot;That it would be a good deed to heave him overboard.&quot; But we were now within sight of port, when of a sudden the wind fell, and the penitent relapsed, begging all of us that were present, as we were gentlemen, not to say anything of what had passed. He had not been ashore above two days, when one of the company began to rally him upon his devotion on shipboard, which the other denied in so high terms, that it produced the lie on both sides, and ended in a duel. The atheist was run through the body, and after some loss of blood, became as good a Christian as he was at sea, till he found that his wound was not mortal. He is at present one of the free-thinkers of the age, and now writing a pamphlet against several received opinions concerning the existence of fairies. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Addison </span>(1671&#8212;1719), <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tattler.&quot; </span></p>

It is but the heart&#39;s echo to repeat the words after it. Except when the tongue doth run before the wit, the heart doth dictate to the mouth; it suggests what it shall say. The heart is the soul&#39;s herald : look what she will have proclaimed, the heart reads it, and the mouth cries it. The tongue saith nought but what the heart saith first. Nay, in very deed, the truest and kindest speech is the heart&#39;s.

It is from him that wicked men have that strength they have to commit sin, therefore sin proceeds from atheism, especially these plotting sins; for if God were more thought on, he would take off the soul from sinful contrivings, and fix it upon himself.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sibbes. </span></p>

Implies a strange inclination in them to devour the saints, and that they take as great delight therein as a hungry man in eating, and that it is natural to them to molest them. The Scripture compares them, for their hateful qualities, to the lions and bears, to foxes for subtlety, to wild bulls, to greedy swine, to scorpions, to briers and thorns (grievous and vexing things). The Scripture represents them as industrious and unwearied in their bloody enterprises, they cannot sleep without doing mischief. Herodias had rather have the blood of a saint than half a kingdom. Hainan would pay a great fine to the king that the scattered Jews (who keep not the king&#39;s laws) may be cut off. Wicked men will run the hazard of damning their own souls, rather than not fling a dagger at the apple of God&#39;s eye. Though they know what one word&#8212;aha !&#8212;cost, yet they will break through all natural, civil, and moral obligations, to ruin God&#39;s people. The Holy Ghost calls them &quot;implacable&quot; men, fierce and headstrong; they are like the hot oven for fury, like the sea for boundless rage; yet &quot; who hath believed &quot; this Scripture &quot; report?&quot; Did we believe what enemies all wicked men are unto all saints, we should not lean to our own prudence and discretion to secure us from any danger by these men; we would get an ark to secure us from the deluge of their wrath; if at any time we be cast among them and delivered, we would bless God with the three children, that the hot fiery oven did not consume us; we would not wonder when we hear of any of their barbarous cruelty, but rather wonder at God&#39;s restraining them every day; we would be suspicious of receiving hurt when cast among light and frothy companions; we would shun their company as we do lions and scorpions; we would never commit any trust or secret into their hands; we would not be lighthearted whilst in their society; we would not rely on their promises any more than we would on the promise of the devil, their father; we would long for heaven, to be delivered from &quot; the tents of Kedar;&quot; we would not count any of the saints secured from danger, though related to any great wicked man; we would not twist ourselves with them by matching ourselves or children to these sons and daughters of Belial ; neither would we make choice of devils to be our servants.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Lewis </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Studcley. </span></span></p>

We may look through all the Shasters and Vedas of the Hindoo, the Koran of the Mahometan, the legislation of the Greek, and the code of the Roman, aye, and the Talmud of the Jew, the bitterest of all; and not in one single line or page shall we find a vestige or trace of that tenderness, compassion, or sympathy for the wrongs, and oppressions, and trials, and sorrows of God&#39;s poor, which the Christian&#39;s Bible evidences in almost every page. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Barton </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bouchicr. </span></p>
