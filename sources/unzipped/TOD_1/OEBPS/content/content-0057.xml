Herod began hunting him down as soon as he appeared. Poverty, the hatred of men, and the temptation of Satan, joiued in the pursuit. There always was some &quot; dog,&quot; or &quot; bull,&quot; or &quot; unicorn,&quot; ready to attack him. After his first sermon the huntsmen gathered about him, but he was too fleet of foot, and escaped. The church had long seen the Messiah &quot; like a roe, or a young hart, upon the mountains,&quot; had &quot;heard the voice of her Beloved,&quot; and had cried out, &quot;Behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills ;&quot; sometimes he was even seen, with the dawn of the day, in the neighbourhood of the temple, and beside the enclosures of the vineyards.

Elace of his sufferings, and the latter the sublime acclivities of light, glory, and onour, where the &quot; hart &quot; shall be hunted no more. But in the afternoon, the huntsmen who had been following the &quot; young roe&quot; from early day-break, had succeeded in driviug him to the mountains of Bether. Christ found Calvary a craggy, jagged, and fearful hill&#8212;&quot; a mountain of division.&quot; Here he was driven by the huntsmen to the edges of the awful precipices yawning destruction from below, while he was surrounded and held at bay by all the beasts of prey and monsters of the infernal forest. The &quot;unicorn,&quot; and the &quot;bulls of Bashan,&quot; gored him with their horns; the great &quot;lion&quot; roared at him; and the &quot;dog&quot; fastened himself upon him. But he foiled them all. In his own time he bowed his head and gave up the ghost. He was buried in a new grave; and his assailants reckoned upon complete victory. They had not considered that he was a &quot;morning hart.&quot; Surely enough, at the appointed time, did he escape from the hunter&#39;s net, and stand forth on the mountains of Israel <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Alive, </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>never, </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Neveh </span>to die again.

If a snake had escaped the hart after being drawn out by the hart by its breath, it was said to be more vehemently poisonous than before.

The condition of Christ in respect of his human state (not the divine), is in all outward appearances, like ours; we conceive the saints&#39; condition very lamentable at times, as if God were for ever gone. And Christ (to teach us to cry after God the Father, like children after the mother, whose very stepping but nt the door, ofttimes makes the babe believe, and so saith that&#8226;his father is gone for ever), presents in his own sufferings how much he is sensible of ours in that case.

Principally it&#39;s a support in these two respects, as it <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preventive </span>of your final desertion, and a comfortable pattern to you in your present sad desertions. 1. Christ&#39;s desertion is <span style='font-style:italic;'>preventive </span>of your final desertion. Because he was forsaken for a time you shall not be forsaken for ever. For he was forsaken for you. It is every way as much for the dear Son of God, the darling delight of his soul, to be forsaken of God for a time, as if such a poor inconsiderable thing as thou art shouldst be cast off to eternity. Now, this being equivalent and borne in thy room, must needs give thee the highest security in the world that God will never finally withdraw from thee. 2. Moreover, this sad desertion of Christ becomes a comfortable <span style='font-style:italic;'>pattern </span>to poor deserted souls in divers respects; and the proper business of such souls, at such times, is to eye it believingly. Though God deserted Christ, yet at the same time he powerfully supported him. His omnipotent arms were under him, though his pleased face was hid from him. He had not indeed his smiles, but he had his supportations. So, Christian, just so shall it be with thee. Thy God may turn away his face, he will not pluck away his arm. &#39;When one asked of holy Mr. Baines how the case stood with his soul<sub>i</sub> he answered, &quot; Supports I have, though suavities I<a id='GBS.PA379.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.396.1.0.box.221.301.1295.489.q.50'>

We turn him out of doors and bid him begone out of our sight, and there he sighs and weeps; but however fori he humbling of him, we will not presently take him into house and favour; yet we order, at least permit the servants to carry him meat and drink: here is fatherly care and support, though no former smiles or manifested delights. . . . Though God forsook Christ, yet at that time he could justify God. So you read, &quot;O my God (saith he), I cry in the day time; but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent; but thou art holy.&quot; Is not thy spirit according to thy measure, framed like Christ&#39;s in this; canst thou not, say even when he writes bitter things against thee, he is a holy, faithful and good God for all this!

He was under violent pain in the garden, and on the cross; ineffable was the sorrow that he felt, being forsaken of his Father, deserted by his disciples, affronted and reproached by his enemies, and under a curse for us. This Sun was under a doleful eclipse, this living Lord was pleased to die, and in his death was under the frowns of an angry God. That face was then hid from him that had always smiled before; and his soul felt that horror and that darkness which it had never felt before. So that there was no separation between the divine and human nature, yet he suffered pains equal to those which we had deserved to suffer in hell for ever. God so suspended the efficacies of his grace that it displayed in that hour none of its force and virtue on him. He had no comfort from heaven, none from his angels, none from his friends, even in that sorrowful hour when he needed comfort most.

The child knows that the parent yearns over him. His importunity is strengthened by confidence in paternal love. He keeps not silence, he gives him no rest because he confides in his power and willingness to grant the desired relief. This is natural.

Haply thou shalt find he denies thee, but it is with a smiling countenance, and ushers it in with some expressions of grace and favour, that may assure thee his denial proceeds not from displeasure. As you would do with a dear friend, who, may be, comes to borrow a sum of money of you; lend it you dare not, because you see plainly it is not for his good; but in giving him the denial, lest he should misinterpret it, as proceeding from want of love and respect, you preface it with some kind of language of your hearty affection to him, as that you love him, and therefore deny him, and shall be ready to do for him more than that comes to. Thus God sometimes wraps up his denials in such sweet intimations of love, as prevents all jealousies arising in the hearts of his people. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

Wherefore, the stripes, the crown of thorns, the bufferings, the cross, the gall, the vinegar, and other bodily torments, besides that they torment the body, are often a means for promoting the divine honour, which it holds in esteem above all else. But to bluspheme God, to give the lie to eternal truths, to deface the supreme demonstrations of the divinity and majesty of the Son of God (although God knoweth how to extract from these things the good which he intends), nevertheless are, in their nature, things, which, from their so greatly affecting the divine honour, although they may be, for just considerations, endured, can never be desired by any one, but must be abhorrent to all. Our Lord then, being, of all, the most zealous for the divine honour, for which he also died, found in this kind of suffering, more than in all other, much to abhor and nothing to desire.

The argument on which it is founded is most forcible and conclusive. At the same time, it is the most seasonable and appropriate that can be urged. We may thus paraphrase it, &quot;I am now brought as a man to my last extremity. It is said that God disowns me; but it cannot be so. My first moment of existence he tenderly cared for. When I could not even ask for, or think of his kindness, he bestowed it upon me.

Such a, feeling of languor and faintness supervened that language fails to express it, and the emblem of &quot;water poured out&quot; is employed to represent it. As the water falls from the vessel to the earth, see how its particles separate farther and farther from each other. Its velocity increases as it falls. It has no power to stay itself midway, much less to return to its place. It is the very picture of utter weakness. So did our Lord feel himself to be when hanging on the cross. He was faint with weakness. The sensations experienced when about to faint away are very overpowering. We appear to our own consciousness to be nothing but weakness, as water poured out. All our bones feel relaxed and out of joint; we seem as though we had none. The strength of bone is gone, the knitting of the joints is loosened, and the muscular vigour fled. A sickly giddiness overcomes us. We have no power to bear up. All heart is lost. Our strength disappears like that of wax, of melting wax, which drops upon surrounding objects, and is lost. Daniel thus describes his sensations on beholding the great vision, &quot;There remained no strength in me: for my vigour was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength.&quot; Dan. x. 8. In regard, however, to the faintness which our Lord experienced, we ought to notice this additional and remarkable circumstance, that he did not altogether faint away. The relief of insensibility he refused to take. When consciousness ceases, all perception of pain is necessarily and instantly terminated. But our Lord retained his full consciousness throughout this awful scene; and patiently endured for a considerable period, those, to us, insupportable sensations which precede the actual swoon.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stevenson. </span></p>

A circle of several miles in circumference is beat round ; and the men, driving all before them, and narrowing as they advance, inclose the prey on every side.

The tearing asunder of the tender fibres of the hands and feet, the lacerating of so many nerves, and bursting so many blood-vessels, must be productive of intense agony. The nerves of the hand and foot are intimately connected, through the arm and leg, with the nerves of the whole body; their laceration therefore must be felt over the entire frame. Witness the melancholy result of even a needle&#39;s puncture in even one of the remotest nerves. A spasm is not unfrequently produced by it in the muscles of the face, which locks the jaws inseparably. When, therefore the hands and feet of our blessed Lord were transfixed with nails, he must have felt the sharpest pangs shoot through every part of his body. Sppported only by his lacerated limbs, and suspended from his pierced hands, our Lord had nearly six hours&#39; torment to endure.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stevenson. </span></p>

Christ did submit to suffer naked, hereby to teach us :&#8212;1. That all flesh are really naked before God by reason of sin (Exodus xxxii. 25; 2 Chron. xxviii. 19), and therefore our Surety behoved to suffer naked. 2. That ha offered himself a real captive in his sufferings, that so he might fully satisfy justice by being under the power of his enemies, till he redeemed himself by the strong hand, having fully paid the price; for therefore did he submit to be stripped naked, as conquerors use to do with prisoners. 3. That by thus suffering nuked he would expiate our abuse of apparel, and purchase to us a liberty to make use of suitable raiment, and such as becometh us in our station. 4. That by this suffering naked he would purchase unto them who flee to him, to be covered with righteousness and glory, and to walk with him in white for ever, and would point out the nakedness of those who, not being found clothed with his righteousness, shall not be clothed upon with immortality and glory. 2 Cor. v. 2, 3. 5. He would also by this, teach all his followers to resolve on nakedness in their following of him, as a part of their conformity with their Head (1 John iv. 17; Rom. viii. 35; Heb. xi. 37), and that therefore they should not dote much on their apparel when they have it.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>George </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Huteheson, </span>1657.</p>

It furnishes us with two interesting ideas; the nature of true conversion&#8212;and the extent of it under the reign of the Messiah. 1. The <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Nature </span>of true conversion :&#8212;It is to <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;remember&quot;</span>&#8212;to &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>turn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span>&quot;&#8212;and to &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>worship </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him.&quot; </span>This is a plain and simple process. Perhaps the first religious exercise of mind of which we are conscious is reflection. A state of unregeneracy is a state of forgetfulness. God is forgotten. Sinners have lost all just sense of his glory, authority, mercy, and judgment; living as if there were no God, or as if they thought there was none. But if ever we are brought to be the subjects of true conversion, we shall be brought to remember these things. This divine change is fitly expressed by the case of the prodigal, who is said to have <span style='font-style:italic;'>come </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>himself, </span>or to his right mind. But further, true conversion consists not only in remembering but in <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;&#39;turning </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>This part of the passage is expressive of a cordial relinquishment of our idols, whatever they have been, aud an acquiescence in the gospel way of salvation by Christ alone. Once more, true conversion to Christ will be accompanied with the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;worship&quot; </span>of him. Worship, as a religious exercise, is the homage of the heart, presented to God</p>

He sets before his mind individual cases and particular facts. He appears to look upon this picture of the future as we do upon a grand historical painting of the past. It seems natural to gaze with silent admiration on the picture as a whole, then to fix the attention on particular groups, and testify our sense of the general excellence, by expatiating on the truth and beauty of the several parts. <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stevenson. </span></p>

The idea is taken from the operations of the husbandman who carefully reserves every year a portion of his grain for seed. Though it be small, compared with all the produce of his harvest, yet he prizes it very highly and estimates it by the value of that crop which it may yield in the succeeding autumn. Nor does he look only to the quantity, he pays particular regard to the quality of the seed. He reserves only the best, nay, he will put away his own if spoiled, that he may procure better. The very smallest quantity of really good seed, is, to him, au object of great desire, and if by grievous failure of crops, he should not be able to procure more than a single grain, yet would he accept it thankfully, preserve it carefully, and plant it in the most favourable soil. Such is the source from which the metaphor is taken.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stevenson. </span></p>

He compares himself to a creature weak, defenceless, and foolish, and he takes God to be his Provider, Preserver, Director, and, indeed, his everything. No man has a right to consider himself the Lord&#39;s sheep unless his nature has been renewed, for the scriptural description of unconverted men does not picture them as sheep, but as wolves or goats. A sheep is an object of property, not a wild animal; its owner sets great store by it, and frequently it is bought with a great price. It is well to know, as certainly as David did, that we belong to the Lord. There is a noble tone of confidence about this sentence. There is no &quot;if&quot; nor &quot; but,&quot; nor even &quot;I hope so;&quot; but he says, &quot;The Lord <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span>my shepherd.&quot; We must cultivate the spirit of assured dependence upon our heavenly Father. The sweetest word of the whole is that monosyllable, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>My.&quot; </span>He does not say, &quot; The Lord is the shepherd of the world at large, and leadeth forth the multitude as his flock,&quot; but &quot; The Lord is <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>shepherd ; &quot; if he be a Shepherd to no one else, he is a Shepherd to <span style='font-style:italic;'>me; </span>he cares for <span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span>watches over <span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span>and preserves <span style='font-style:italic;'>me. </span>The words are in the present tense.

There is no fear of biting the bare ground where the grass is long enough for the flock to lie down in it. Sweet and full are the doctrines of the gospel; fit food for souls, as tender grass is natural nutriment for sheep. When by faith we are enabled to find rest in the promises, we are like the sheep that lie down in the midst of the pasture; we find at the same moment both provender and peace, rest and refreshment, serenity and satisfaction. But observe: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>maketh </span>me to lie down.&quot; It is the Lord who graciously enables us to perceive the preciousness of his truth, and to feed upon it.

They know the blessedness of it, but they cannot say that this blessedness is theirs.

Some one has said that when there is a shadow there must be light somewhere, and so there is. Death stands by the side of the highway in which we have to travel, and the light of heaven shining upou him throws a shadow across our path; let us then rejoice that there is a light beyond. Nobody is afraid of a shadow, for a shadow cannot stop a man&#39;s pathway even for a moment. The shadow of a dog cannot bite; the shadow of a sword cannot kill; the shadow of death cannot destroy us. Let us not, therefore, be afraid. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evil.&#39;&#39; </span>He does not say there shall not be any evil; he had got beyond even that high assurance, and knew that Jesus had put all evil away; but &quot; I will/car no evil;&quot; as if even his fears, those shadows of evil, were gone for ever. The worst evils of life are those which do not exist except in our imagination. If we had no troubles but real troubles, we should not have a tenth part of our present sorrows. We feel a thousand deaths in fearing one, but the psalmist was cured of the disease of fearing. &quot;I will fear <span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evil,&quot; </span>not even the Evil One himself; I will not dread the last enemy, I will look upon him as a conquered foe, an enemy to be destroyed, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>This is the joy of the Christian !&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span>art with me.&quot; The little child out at sea in the storm is not frightened like all the other passengers on board the vessel, it is asleep in its mother&#39;s bosom; it is enough for it that its mother is with it; and it should be enough for the believer to know that Christ is with him. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span>art with me; I have, in having thee, all that I can crave : I have perfect comfort and absolute security, for <span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span>art with me.&quot; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rod </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>staff,&quot; </span>by which thou governest and rulest thy flock, the ensigns of thy sovereignty and of thy gracious care&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comfort </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.&quot; </span>I will believe that thou reignest still.

A wise man might prefer of the two to die, for those who shall not die, but who &quot; shall bo caught up together with the Lord in the air,&quot; will be losers rather than gainers. They will lose that actual fellowship with Christ in the tomb which dying saints will have, and we are expressly told they shall have no preference beyond those who are asleep. Let us be of Paul&#39;s mind when he said that &quot;To die is gain,&quot; and think of &quot;departing to be with Christ, which is far better.&quot; This twentythird psalm is not worn out, and it is as sweet in a believer&#39;s ear now as it was&#9632; in David&#39;s time, let novelty-hunters say what they will.</p>

Every Christian is a priest, but he cannot execute the priestly office without unction, aud hence we must go day by day to God the Holy Ghost, that wo may have our heads anointed with oil.

It is but a moment&#39;s opening of his soul; but, as wheu one, walking the winter street sees the door opened for some one to enter, and the red light streams a moment forth, and the forms of gay children are running to greet the comer, and genial music sounds, though the door shuts and leaves the night black, yet it cannot shut back again all that the eyes, the ear, the heart, and the imagination have seen&#8212;so in this Psalm, though it is but a moment&#39;s opening of the soul, are emitted truths of peace and consolation that will never be absent from the world. The twenty-third Psalm is the nightingale of the Psalms. It is small, of a homely feather, singing shyly out of obscurity; but, oh! it has filled the air of the whole world with melodious joy, greater than the heart can conceive. Blessed be the day on which that Psalm was born! What would you say of a pilgrim commissioned of God to travel up and down the earth singing a strange melody, which, when one heard, caused him to forget whatever sorrow he had? And so the singing angel goes on his way through all lands, singing in the language of every nation, driving away trouble by the pulses of the air which his tongue moves with divine power. Behold just such an one! This pilgrim God has sent to speak in every language on the globe. It has charmed more griefs to rest than all the philosophy of the world. It has remanded to their dungeon more felon thoughts, more black doubts, more thieving sorrows, than there are sands on the sea-shore. It has comforted the noble host of the poor. It has sung courage to the army of the disappointed. It has poured balm and consolation into the heart of the sick, of captives in dungeons, of widows in their pinching griefs, of orphans in their loneliness. Dying soldiers have died easier as it was read to them; ghastly hospitals have<a id='GBS.PA403.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.420.1.0.box.218.305.1297.353.q.60'>
been illuminated ; it has visited the prisoner, and broken his chains, and, like Peter&#39;s angel, led him forth in imagination, and sung him back to his home again. It has made the dying Christian slave freer than his master, and consoled those whom, dying, he left behind mourning, not so much that he was gone, as because they were left behind, and could not go too. Nor is its work done. It will go singing to your children and my children, and to their children, through all the generations of time; nor will it fold its wings till the last pilgrim is safe, and time ended; and then it shall fly back to the bosom of God, whence it issued, and sound on, mingled with all those sounds of celestial joy which make heaven musical for ever.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ward </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Beecher, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Life </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thoughts.&#39;&#39; </span></span></p>

the reasons are, first, because true grace makes no object amiss to gather some gracious instruction: it skills not what the object be, so that the heart be gracious; for that never wants matter to work upon. And secondly, it must needs be so, for such are guided by God&#39;s Spirit, and therefore are directed to a spiritual use of all things.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Smith&#39;s </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Chiefe </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Shepheard,&quot; </span>1625.</span></p>

Satan deals seemingly sweet, that he may draw you into sin, but in the end he will be really bitter to you. Christ, indeed, is seemingly bitter to keep you from sin, hedging up your way with thorns. But he will be really s.weet if you come into his flock, even notwithstanding your sins. Thou looktst into Christ&#39;s fold, and thou seest it hedged and fenced all about to keep you in from sin, and this keeps thee from entering; but, oh ! let it not. Chnst, indeed, is unwilling that any of his should wander, and if they be unwilling too, it&#39;s well. And if they wander he&#39;ll fetch them in, it may be with his shepherd&#39;s <span style='font-style:italic;'>dog </span>(some affliction) ; but he&#39;ll not be, as we say, <span style='font-style:italic;'>dogged </span>himself. No, he is and will be sweet. It may be, now Satan smiles, and is pleasant to you while you sin; but know, he&#39;ll be bitter in the end. He that sings syren-like now, will devour lion-like at last. He&#39;ll torment you and vex you, and be burning and bitterness to you. () come in therefore to Jesus Christ; let him be now the shepherd of thy soul. And know then, he&#39;ll be sweet in endeavouring to keep thee from sin before thou commit it: nnd he&#39;ll be sweet in delivering thee from sin after thou hast committed it. O that this thought&#8212;that Jesus Christ is sweet in his carriage unto all his members, unto all his flock, especially the sinning ones, might persuade the hearts of some sinners to come in unto his fold. <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Durant, </span>1652.</p>

The same thing is affirmed of Christ, or rather indeed Christ affirmeth the same thing of himself, &quot;I know them, and they follow me.&quot; John x. 27. Yea, doubtless, he that hath numbered the stars, and calleth them all by their names, yea, the very hairs of our head, taketh special notice of his own children, &quot;the sheep of his pasture,&quot; that they may be provided for and protected from all danger. Secondly, a good shepherd must have skill in the pasturing of his sheep, and in bringing them into such fruitful ground, as they may buttle and thrive upon : a good shepherd will not suffer his sheep to feed upon rotten soil, but in wholesome pastures. . . . Thirdly, a good shepherd, knowing the straying nature of his sheep, is so much the more diligent to watch over them, and if at any time they go astray, he brings them back again. This is the Lord&#39;s merciful dealing towards poor wandering souls. . . . Fourthly, a good shepherd must have will to feed his sheep according to his skill : the Lord of all others is most willing to provide for his sheep. How earnest is Christ with Feter, to &quot; feed his sheep,&quot; urging him unto it three several times! Fifthly, a good shepherd is provided to defend his flock. . . . The Lord is every way provided for the safety and defence of his sheep, as David confesseth in this Psalm (verse 4), &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rod </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>s&#39;aff </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comfort </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me.*&#39; </span>And again, &quot;I took unto me two staves&quot; (saith the Lord), &quot;the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.&quot; Zech. xi. 7. Sixthly, it is the property of a good shepherd, that if any of his sheep be weak and feeble, or his lambs young, for their safety and recovery he will bear them in his arms. The Lord is not</p>
