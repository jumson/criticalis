The wise man trusts in his wisdom, the strong man in his strength, the rich man in his riches; but this trusting in God is the foolishest thing in the world.&quot; The reasons of it are&#8212;1. They know not God ; and it is <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span>foolish thing to trust one knows not whom. 2. They are enemies to God, and God is their enemy; and they account it a foolish thing to trust their enemy. 3. They know not the way of God&#39;s assistance and help. And&#8212;4. They seek for such help, such assistance, such supplies, as God will not give; to be delivered, to serve their lusts; to be preserved, to execute their rage, filthiness, and folly. They have no other design or end of these things; and God will give none of them. And it is a foolish thing in any man to trust God to be preserved in sin. It is true, their folly is their wisdom, considering their state and condition. It is a folly to trust in God to live in sin, and despise the counsel of the poor.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Owen. </span></p>

Whence observe this doctrine; that true godliness is that which breeds the quarrel between God&#39;s children and the wicked. Ungodly men may say what they list, as, namely, that they hate and dislike them for that they are proud and saucy in meddling with their betters; for that they are so scornful and disdainful towards their neighbours; for that they are malcontent, and turbulent, and I know not what; but the true reason is yielded by the Lord in this place, to wit, because they make him their stay and their confidence, and will not depend upon lying vanities as the men of the world do.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dod. </span></p>

The heavens are not pure in thy sight, and thou clmrgedst thine angels with folly, who then of mortal mould shall dwell with thee, thou dread consuming fire? A sense of the glory of the Lord and of the holiness which becomes his house, his service, and his attendants, excites the humble mind to ask the solemn question before us. Where angels bow with veiled faces, how shall man be able to worship at all? The unthinking many imagine it to be a very easy matter to approach the Most High, and when professedly engaged in his worship they have no questionings of heart as to their fitness for it; but truly humbled souls often shrink under a sense of utter unworthiness, and would not dare to approach the throne of the God of holiness if it were not for him, our Lord, our Advocate, who can abide in the heavenly temple, because his righteousness endureth for ever. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>abide </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tabernacle</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>? &quot; </span>Who shall be admitted to be one of the household of God, to sojourn under his roof and enjoy communion with himself? &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dwell </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>holyhillV </span>Who shall be a citizen of Zion, and an inhabitant of the heavenly Jerusalem? The question is raised, because it is a question. All men have not this privilege, nay, even among professors there are aliens from the commonwealth, who have no secret intercourse with God. On the grounds of law no mere man can dwell with God,, for there is not one upon earth who answers to the just requirements mentioned in the succeeding verses. The questions in tho text are asked of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span>as if none but the Infinite Mind could answer them so as to satisfy the unquiet conscience. We must know from the Lord of the tabernacle what are the qualifications for his service, and when we have been taught of him, we shall clearly see that only our spotless Lord Jesus, and those who are conformed unto his image, can ever stand with acceptance before the Majesty on high.</p>

In perfection this holiness is found only in the Man of Sorrows, but in a measure it is wrought in all his people by the Holy Ghost. Faith and the graces of the Spirit are not mentioned, because this is a description of outward character, and where fruits are found the root may not be seen, but it is surely there. Observe the accepted man&#39;s <span style='font-style:italic;'>walk, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>work, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>word. </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walketh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>uprightly,&quot; </span>he keeps himself erect as those do who traverse high ropes; if they lean on one side over they must go, or as those who carry precious but fragile ware in baskets on their heads, who lose all if they lose their perpendicular. True believers do not cringe as flatterers, wriggle as serpents, bend double as earth-grubbers, or crook on one side as those who have sinister aims; they have the strong backbone of the vital principle of grace within, and being themselves upright, they are able to walk uprightly. Walking is of far more importance than talking. He only is right who is upright in walk and <span style='font-style:italic;'>downright </span>in honesty. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>worketh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteousness.</span>&#39;&#39; His faith shows&#8226;itself by good works, and therefore is no dead faith. God&#39;s house is a hive for workers, not a nest for drones. Those who rejoice thai everything is done for them by another, even the Lord Jesus, and therefore hate legality, are the best doers in the world upon gospd principles. If we are not positively serving the Lord, and doing his holy will to the best of our power, we may seriously debate our interest in divine things, for trees which bear no fruit must be hewn down and cast into the fire. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>spcaketh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.</span>&quot; The fool in the last psalm spoke falsely in his heart ; observe both here and elsewhere in the two psalms, the striking contrast. Saints not only desire to love and speak truth with their lips, but they seek to be true within; they will not lie even in the closet of their hearts, for God is there to listen ; they scorn double meanings, evasions, equivocations, white lies, flatteries, and deceptions. Though truths, like roses, have thorns about them, good men wear them in their bosoms. Our heart must be the sanctuary and&#39;refuge of truth, should it be banished from all the world beside, and hunted from among men ; at all risk we must entertain the angel of truth, for truth is God&#39;s daughter. We must be careful that the heart is really fixed and settled in principle, for tenderness of conscience towards truthfulness, like the bloom on a peach, needs gentle handling, and once lost it were hard to regain it. Jesus was the mirror of sincerity and holiness. Oh, to be more and more fashioned after his similitude!</p>

wounds are very hard to heal; its worst wounds are not with its edge to our face, but with its back when our head is turned. Under the law, a night hawk was an unclean bird, and its human image is abominable everywhere. All slanderers are the devil&#39;s bellows to blow up contention, but ihose are the worst which blow at the back of the tire. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Nor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>doeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ecil </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>neighbour.&#39;&#39; </span>Pie who bridles his tongue will not give a licence to his hand.

If there were no gratified hearers of ill reports, there would be an end of the trade of spreading them. Trapp says, that &quot;the tale-bearer carrieth the devil in his tongue, and the tale-hearer carries the devil in his ear.&quot; The original may be translated, &quot;endurcth ;&quot; implyingthat it is a sin to endure or tolerate tale-bearers. &quot;Show that man out !&quot; we should say of a drunkard, yet it is very questionable if his unmannerly behaviour will do us so much mischief as the tale-bearer&#39;s insinuating story. &quot;Call for a rwliceman!&quot; we say if we see a thief at bis business; ought we to feel no indignation when we hear a gossip at her work? Mad dog! Mad dog!! is a terrible hue and cry, but there are few curs whose bite is so dangerous as a busybody&#39;s tongue. Fire! fire !! is an alarming note, but the tale bearer&#39;s tongue is set on fire of hell, and those who indulge it had better mend their manners, or they may find that there is fire in hell for unbridled tongues. Our Lord spake evil of no man, but breathed a prayer for his foes; we must be like him, or we shall never be with him.</span></p>

Honour to whom honour is due. To all good men we owe a debt of honour, and we have no right to hand over what is their due to vile persons who happen to be in high places. When bad men are in office, it is our duty to respect the office, but wo cannot so violate our consciences as to do otherwise than contemn the men ; and on the other hand, when true saints are in poverty and distress, we must sympathize with their afflictions and honour the men none the less. We may honour the roughest cabinet for the sake of the jewels, but we must not prize false gems because of their setting. A sinner in a gold chain and silken robes is no more to be compared with a saint in rags than a rushlight in a silver candlestic k with the sun behind a cloud. The proverb says, that &quot;ugly women, finely dressed, arc the uglier for it,&quot; and so mean men in high estate are the moie mean because of it. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>swcarelh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>own </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hurt, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>changeth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not.&quot; </span>Scriptural saints under the New Testament rule &quot; swear not at all,&quot; but their word is as good as an oath : those men of God who think it right to swear, are careful and prayerful lest they should even seem to overshoot the mark. When engagements have been entered into which turn out to be unprofitable, &quot;the saints are men of honour still.&quot; Our blessed Surety swore to his own hurt, but how gloriously he stood to his suretyship! what a comfort to us that he changeth not, and what an example to us to be scrupulously and precisely exact in fulfilling our covenants with others! The most far-seeing trader may enter into engagements which turn out to be serious losses, but whatever else he loses, if he keeps his honour, his losses will be bearable; if that be lost all is lost.</p>

To the first, answer may be, that in this, and in all other places of Holy Scripture, where good worki are commanded or commended in any, faith is ever presupposed, according to that apostolical maxim, &quot; Whatsoever is not of faith is sin;&quot; &quot;Without me,&quot; saith our blessed Saviour, &quot;ye can do nothing&quot; (John xv. 5); and without faith in him it is impossible to please God (lieb. xi. 6) ; <span style='font-style:italic;'>fides </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>estoperum </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forties, </span>as Paulinus wittily: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Faith </span>(as our church speaks), <span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>nest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>albeit our birds be never so fair, though haply we <span style='font-style:italic;'>do </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>right, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>speak </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>triw, </span>yet all these will be lost, except it be brought forth in a true belief.&quot; Aristides was so just in his government that he would not tread awry for any respect to friend or despite of foe. Pomponius is said to have been so true, that he never made lie himself, nor suffered a lie in other. Curtius at Rome, Menaiceus at Thebes, Codrus at Athens, exposed themselves unto voluntary death, for the good of their neighbours and country : yet, because they wanted the rest of true faith in the world&#39;s Saviour, where to lay their young, we cannot (if we speak with our prophet here from God&#39;s oracle), say that they shall ever rest upon his holy hill. Another answer may be, that faith is an inward and hidden grace, and many deceive themselves and others with a feigned profession thereof, and therefore the Holy Spirit will have every man&#39;s faith to be tried and known by their fruits, and howsoever, eternal life be promised to faith, and eternal damnation be threatened against infidelity, yet the sentence of salvation and condemnation shall be pronounced according to works, as tho clearest evidence of both. It is truly said, out of Bernard, that although our good works are not <span style='font-style:italic;'>causa </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>regnandi, </span>yet they be <span style='font-style:italic;'>via </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>regni, </span>the causeway wherein, albeit not the cause wherefore, we must ascend God&#39;s holy hill. To the second demand, why the duties immediately belonging to God, are not mentioned here, but only such as concern our brother? Answer is made, that this question is propounded of such as, living in the visible church, openly<a id='GBS.PA203.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.220.1.0.box.250.329.1294.461.q.60'>
profess the faith, and would seem to be .devout, hearing the word of God, and calling upon his name; for of such as are profane atheists, and do not so much as make a semblance of holiness, there is no question to be made, for, without all doubt, there can be no resting place for such in the kingdom of heaven. Now that we may discern aright which of those&#39; that profess religion are sound, and which unsound ; the marks are not to be taken from an outward hearing of the word, or receiving of the sacraments, and much less from a formal observation of human traditions in God&#39;s tabernacle (for all these things hypocrites usually perform), but from the duties of righteousness, giving every man his due, because the touchstone of piety towards God is charity towards our brother. &quot;Herein,&quot; saith John, &quot;are the children of God known, and the children of the devil: whosoever doth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.&quot;&#39;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Boyt. </span></span></p>

Study truth in the inward parts; let integrity and truth always accompany thee, and preserve thee : speak the truth in thy heart. I am thankful for any conviction and sense I have of the evil of lying; Lord, increase my abhorrence of it: as a further assistance and help against this mean, sordid, pernicious vice, I would endeavour, and resolve, in pursuit of the directions laid before us in the sermon, to mortify those passions and corruptions from whence this sin of lying more ordinarily flows, and which are the chief occasion of it, as &quot;out of the heart proceed evil thoughts&quot; (Matt. xv. 19); so, from the same fountain proceed evil words. And I would, with the greatest zeal, set myself against such corruptions as upon observation I find more commonly betray me into this iniquity : pride often indites our speech, and coins many a lie; so envy, covetousness, malice, etc. I would endeavour to cleanse myself from all this fllthiness : there never will be a mortified tongue while there is an uumortified heart. If I love the world inordinately, it is a thousand to one I shall be often stretching a point to promote a worldly interest; and if I hate my brother, it is the same odds I shall reproach him. Lord, help me to purge the fountain, and then the streams will be pure. When the spring of a clock, and. all the movements are right, the hand will go right; and so it is here. The tongue follows the inward inclination. I would resolve to do nothing that may need a lie. If Gehazi&#39;s covetousness had not shamed him, he had not wanted a lie to excuse him, &quot;He that walks uprightly, walks surely&quot; and safely in this, as well as other respects. Prov. x. 9. May I do nothing that is dishonourable and mean, nothing that cannot bear the light, and then I shall have little temptation to lying. I would endeavour for a lively sense of the eye of God upon me, acting and speaking in his presence. Lord, I desire to set thee always before me; thou understandest my thoughts as perfectly as others do my words. I would consider beforo I speak, and not speak much or rashly. Prov. xxix. 20. I would often think of the severity of a future judgment, when every secret shall be made manifest, and the hypocrite and liar exposed before angels and men. Lastly, I would frequently beg divine assistance herein. Psalm cxix. 29; Prov. xxx. 8.

For the good name of a man, as saith Solomon, is a precious thing to every one, and to be preferred before much treasure, insomuch that it is no less grievous to hurt a man with the tongue than with a sword: nay, ofttimes the stroke of a tongue is grievouser than the wound of a spear, as it is in the French proverb. And therefore the tongue must be bridled, that we hurt not in any wise the good name of our neighbour; but preserve it unto him safe and sound, as much as in us shall lie. That which he addeth touching evil or injury not to be done to our neighbour, is like unto that which we have seen already concerning the working or exercising of righteousness. He would have us therefore so to exercise all upright dealing, that we might be far from doing any damage or wrong to our neighbours. And by the name of neighbour, is meant every man and woman, as it is plain and evident. For we are all created of God, and placed in this world that we might live uprightly and sincerely together.

To the which fault this is next in degree, wherewith we are too much encumbered, and which we scarce acknowledge to be a fault, when we further and maintain the slanders devised and given out by another against a man, cither by hearing them or by telling them forth to others, as we heard them. For why? It seemeth for the most part to be enough for us if we can say, that we feign not this or that, nor make it of our own heads, but only tell it forth as we heard it of others, without adding anything of our own brain. But as oft as we do this we fail in our duty doing, in not providing for our neighbour&#39;s credit, as were requisite for the things, which being uttered by others ought to be passed over in silence and to lie dead, we gather up, and by telling them forth, disperse them abroad, which whether it be a sin or no, when as we ought by all means possible to wish and do well unto our neighbour, all men do see. And therefore thou that travcllest towards eternal life, must not only not devise false reports and slanders against other men, but also not so much as have them in thy mouth being devised by others, neither by any&#39; means assist or maintain them in slandering; but by all honest and lawful means, provide for the credit and estimation of thy. neighbour, so much as in thee lieth.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Peter </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Baro, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D.D., </span>1580.</span></p>

But the former may seem not to be sufficiently beseeming to a godly man. For why should he contemn or despise others, who is commanded by all means to care for the credit of others, as we heard even now? Nay, a godly man, letting others go, ought to search into himself, and to accuse himself, but not to judge of others. But this saying of the prophet is to be understood rather of the faults than of the person. As every man therefore is to be loved, so are the faults of every man to be hated of the godly. For so is God himself, whom we desire to be like unto, that we might dwell with him, affected and disposed. For why? he hateth no man, nay, he hateth nothing at all in this whole universal world, but only sin. For he is the author and preserver of all things that be; and therefore doth good and wisheth well to nil ; only of sin he is not the author, but the free and unconstrained will of man and Satan. Notwithstanding God doth so greatly hate sin, that by reason thereof he doth sometimes neglect and forsake men, yea, and have them in contempt. So then a godly man hateth no man, nor contemncth any; but yet notwithstanding he disliketh sin in sinful men, and that he sticketh not to let them perceive either by reproving them, or shunning their company, or by doing of some other thing, whereby they may know they are misliked of good men for their enormities, and see themselves to be contemned of others for their wicked and ungodly life.

It appeared to me to be useless to quote opinions in which I cannot agree, especially as this would occupy space better employed. The demanding of excessive and grinding interest is a sin to be detested; the taking of the usual and current interest in a commercial country is not contrary to the law of love. The Jews were not engaged in commerce, and to lend money even at the lowest interest to their fellow farmers in times of poverty would have been usurious; but they might lend to strangers, who would usually be occupied in commerce, because in the commercial world, money is a fruitful thing, and the lender has a right to a part of its products; a loan to enable a non-trader to live over a season of want is quite another matter.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>C. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>If. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>S. </span></p>

It is most commonly taken for an unlawful profit which a person i makes of his money or goods. The Hebrew word for usury signifies biting. The law of God prohibits rigorous imposing conditions of gain for the loan of money or goods, and exacting them without respect to the condition of the borrower, whether he gain or lose; whether poverty occasioned his borrowing, or a visible prospect of gain by employing the borrowed goods. It is said in Exod. xxii. 25, 26, &quot;If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an <span style='font-style:italic;'>usurer, </span>neither shalt thou lay upon him <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury,&quot; </span>etc. And in Lev. xxv. 35, 36, 37, &quot;If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen into decay with thee, then thou shalt relieve him ; yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner, that he may live with thee : take thou no <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury </span>of him,&quot; etc. This law forbids the taking <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury </span>from a brother that was poor, an Israelite reduced to poverty, or from a proselyte; but in Deut. xxiii. 2Q, God seems to tolerate <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury </span>towards strangers; &quot;Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury.&quot; </span>By <span style='font-style:italic;'>strangers, </span>in this passage, some understand the Gentiles in general, or all such as were not Jews, excepting proselytes. Others think that by <span style='font-style:italic;'>strangers </span>are meant the Canaanites, and the other people that were devoted to slavery and subjection; of these the Hebrews were permitted to exact <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury, </span>but not of such <span style='font-style:italic;'>strangers </span>with whom they had no quarrel, and against whom the Lord had not denounced his judgments. The Hebrews were plainly commanded in Exod. xxii. 25, etc., not to receive <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury </span>for money from &#9632; any that borrowed from necessity, as in that case in Neh. v. 5, 7.

And upon this condition, a valuable commentator says, &quot;It seems as lawful for me to receive interest for money, which another takes pains with, improves, but runs the hazard of in trade, as it is to receive rent for my land, which another takes pains with, improves, but runs the hazard of in husbandry.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Alexander </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Cruden, </span>1701&#8212;1770.</p>

The law is not to be understood as a prohibition of interest at any rate whatever, but of excessive interest or usury. The clause, &quot;Thou shalt not be to him as an usurer,&quot; is equivalent to saying, &#39;Thou shalt not domineer and lord it over him rigorously and cruelly.&#39; That this class of men were peculiarly prone to be extortionate and oppressive in their dealings with debtors would seem to be implied by the etymology of the original term for <span style='font-style:italic;'>usury </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>neshek), </span>which comes from a root signifying <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bite; </span>and in</p>

A large rtion of the people had not only mortgaged their lands, vineyards, and houses, t had actually sold their sons and daughters into bondage, to satisfy the claims of their grasping creditors. In this emergency Nehemiuh espoused the cause of the poor, and compelled the rich, against whom he called the people together, to remit the whole of their dues; and, moreover, exacted from&#39; them an oath that they would never afterwards oppress their poor brethren for the payment of those debts. This was not because every part of those proceedings had been contrary to the letter of the Mosaic law, but because it was a flagrant breach of equity under the circumstances. It was taking a cruel and barbarous advantage of the necessities of their brethren, at which God was highly indignant, and which his servants properly rebuked. From this law the Hebrew canonists have gathered a general rule, that &quot; Whoso exacteth of a poor man, and knoweth that he hath not aught to pay him with, he transgresseth against this prohibition, Thou shalt not be to him as an exacting creditor.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>(Maimonides, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ainsworth.) </span>We nowhere learn from the institutes delivered by Moses that the simple taking of interest, especially from the neighbouring nations (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20), was forbidden to the Israelites; but the divine law would give no countenance to the griping and extortionate practices to which miserly money-lenders are always prone. The deserving and industrious poor might sometimes be reduced to such straits, that pecuniary accommodations might be very desirable to them; and towards such God would inculcate a mild, kind, and forbearing spirit, and the precept is enforced by the relation which they sustained to him: <span style='font-style:italic;'>q.d., </span>&quot;Remember that you are lending to <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>people, <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span>poor; and therefore take no advantage of their necessities.

excess than if they had lent on usury avowedly and openly. God, however, will not be dealt with and imposed upon by sophistry and false pretences. He looks upon the thing ns it really is. There is no worse species of usury than an unjust way of making bargains, where equity is disregarded on both sides. Let us, then, remember that all bargains, in which the one party unrighteously strives to make gain by the loss of the other party, whatever name may be given to them, are here condemned. It may be asked, whether all kinds of usury are to be put into this denunciation, and regarded as alike unlawful? If we condemn all without distinction, there is a danger lest many, seeing them* selves brought into such a strait as to find that sin must be incurred, in whatever way they can turn themselves, may be rendered bolder by despair, and may rush headlong into all kinds of usury without choice or discrimination. On the other hand, whenever we concede that something may be lawfully done in this way, many will give themselves loose reins, thinking that a liberty to exercise usury, without control or moderation, has been granted them. In the first place, therefore, I would, above all things, counsel my readers to beware of ingeniously contriving deceitful pretexts by which to take advantage of their fellow men, and let them not imagine that anything can be lawful to them</span></p>

Take thou no usury of him, or increase.&quot; We see that the end for which the law was framed was that man should not cruelly oppress the poor, who ought rather to receive sympathy and compassion. This was, indeed, a part of the judicial law which God appointed for the Jews in particular; but it is a common principle of justice, which extends to all nations, and to all ages, that we should keep ourselves from plundering and devouring the poor who are in distress and want. Whence it follows, that the gain which he who lends his money upon interest acquires, without doing injury to any one, is not to be included under the head of unlawful usury. The Hebrew word =|t?} <span style='font-style:italic;'>neshek, </span>which David employs, being derived from another word which signifies <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bite, </span>sufficiently shows that usuries are condemned in so far as they involve in them, or lead to, a license of robbing or plundering our fellow men. Ezekiel, indeed (chapters xviii. 17, and xxii. 12), seems to condemn the taking of any interest whatever upon money lent; but he, doubtless, has an eye to the unjust and crafty arts of gaining by which the rich devoured the poor people. In short, provided we had engraven on our hearts the rule of equity which Christ prescribes in Matt. vii. 12, &quot;Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,&quot; it would not be necessary to enter into lengthened disputes concerning usury.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lor.. </span></p>

Exod. xxii. 25 ; Lev. xxv. 37 ; Deut. xxiii. 19; Prov. xxviii. 8; Ezek. xviii. 8. In several of the passages referred to, it is expressly supposed that money is lent only to the poor, a supposition which has its ground in the simple relations of the Mosaic times, in which lending, for the purpose of speculation and gain, had no existence. Such lending ought only to be a work of brotherly love; and it is a great violation of that if any one, instead of helping his neighbour, takes advantage of his need lo bring him into still greater straits. The Mosaic regulation in question has, accordingly, its import also for New Testament times. With the interest-lending of capitalists, who borrow for speculation, it has nothing to do. This belongs to a quite different matter, as is implied even by the name <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mordendo, </span>according to which only such usury can be meant as plagues and impoverishes a neighbour.

So the usurer is a soft beast at first to handle, but in continuance of time the hardness of his teeth will eat thee up, both flesh and bouo, if thou beware not. He pleadeth love, but not for thy sake, but for his own ; for as the ivy colleth and claspeth the oak as a lover, but thereby it growcth up and overtoppeth the oak, and sucketh out the juice and sap thereof, that it cannot thrive nor prosper; so the usurer colleth, embraceth, and claspeth in arms the borrower, that thereby himself may grow richer, and suck all wealth, goods, and riches from him, that he never thriveth or prospereth after. The pleasure the usurer showeth is like the playing of the cat with the silly mouse: the cat playeth with the mouse, but the play of the cat is the death of the mouse. The usurer pleasureth the borrower ; but the pleasure of the usurer is the undoing of the borrower. The fox through craft slideth and tumbleth, and maketh much pastime till he come to the prey, then he devoureth : the usurer maketh many fair speeches, giveth out many fair promises, pretendeth very great kindness, until he have got thee within his compass, then he crusheth and cruciateth thee. The usurer preyeth upon the poor, he waxeth rich of the penury of his brother, he clotheth himself with the coat of the naked, he gathereth riches of the indigency and want of his neighbour; he feedeth himself of the bread of the hungry, and devoureth his poor brother, as the great beasts do the smaller; than which, saith Ambrose, there is no greater inhumanity and cruelty, no greater wretchedness and iniquity, as Chrysostom in many places, and Basil upon this Psalm, have well observed.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Turnbull. </span></span></p>

The intercession recorded in John xvii. is but an amphfication of this cry, &quot;Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <span style='font-style:italic;'>are.&quot; </span>When he says &quot; preserve me,&quot; he means his members, his mystical body, himself, and all in him. But while we rejoice in the fact that the Lord Jesus used this prayer for his members, we must not forget that he employed it most surely for himself; he had so emptied himself, and so truly taken upon him the form of a servant, that as man he needed divine keeping even as we do, and often cried unto the strong for strength. Frequently on the mountain-top he breathed forth this desire, and on one occasion in almost the same words, he publicly prayed, &quot;Father, save me from this hour.&quot; (John xii. 27.) If Jesus looked out of himself for protection, how much more must we, his erring followers, do so!</p>

Faith, like the sword of Saul, never returns empty; it overcomes heaven when held in the hand of prayer. As the Saviour prayed, so let us pray, and as he became more than a conqueror, so shall we also through him; let us when buffeted by storms right bravely cry to the Lord as he did, &quot; in thee do I put my trust.&quot;</p>

Although the life-work and death-agony of the Son did reflect unparalleled lustre upon every attribute of God, yet the Most Blessed and Infinitely Happy God stood in no need of the obedience and death of his Son; it was for our sakes that the work of redemption was undertaken, and not because of any lack or want on the part of the Most High. How modestly does the Saviour here estimate his own goodness! What overwhelming reasons have we for imitating his humility !&quot; If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?&quot; (Job <span style='font-style:italic;'>xxxv. </span>7.)</p>

How much more forcibly is this true of us, poor unworthy servants not fit to be mentioned in comparison with the faithful Son of God! Our hope must ever be that haply some poor child of God may be served by us, for the Great Father can never need our aid. Well may we sing the verses of Dr. Watts:</p>

The title of &quot;His Excellency&quot; more properly belongs to the meanest saint than to the greatest governor. The true aristocracy are believers in Jesus. They are the only Right Honourables. Stars and garters are poor distinctions compared with the graces of the Spirit.

Their own opinion of themselves is far other than their Beloved&#39;s opinion of them; they count themselves to be less than nothing, yet he makes much of them, and sets his heart towards them. What wonders the eyes of Divine Love can see where the hands of Infinite Power have been graciously at work. It was this quicksighted affection which led Jesus to see in us a recompense for all his agony, and sustained him under all his sufferings by the joy of redeeming us from going down into the pit.</p>

Jesus hates all wickedness, and especially the high crime of idolatry. The text while it shows our Lord&#39;s abhorrence of sin, shows also the sinner&#39;s greediness after it. Professed believers are often slow towards the true Lord, but sinners &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>hasten </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>after </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>another </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>god.&quot; </span>They run like madmen where we creep like snails.

hundreds not enough.&quot; The cruelties and hardships which men endure for their false gods is wonderful to contemplate ; our missionary reports are a noteworthy comment on this passage; but perhaps our own experience is an equally vivid exposition; for when we have given our heart to idols, sooner or later we have had to smart for it. Near the roots of our self-love all our sorrows lie, and when that idol is overthrown, the sting is gone from grief. Moses broke the golden calf and ground it to powder, and cast it into the water of which he made Israel to drink, and so shall our cherished idols become bitter portions for us, unless we at once forsake them. Our Lord had no selfishness; he served but one Lord, and served him only. As for those who turn aside from Jehovah, he was separate from them, bearing their reproach without the camp. Sin and the Saviour had no communion. He came to destroy, not to patronize or be allied with the works of the devil. Hence he refused the testimony of unclean spirits as to his divinity, for in nothing would he have fellowship with darkness. We should be careful above measure not to connect ourselves in the remotest degree with falsehood in religion; even the most solemn of Popish rites we must abhor. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>drink </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>offerings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blood </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>offer.&quot; </span>The old proverb says, &quot; It is not safe to eat at the devil&#39;s mess, though the spoon be never so long.&quot; The mere mentioning of ill names it were well to avoid,&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>nor </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>take </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>up </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>names </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lips.&quot; </span>If we allow poison upon the lip, it may ere long penetrate to the inwards, and it is well to keep out of the mouth that which we would shut out from the heart. If the Church would enjoy union with Christ, she must break all the bonds of impiety, and keep herself pure from all the pollutions of carnal willworship, which now pollute the service of God. Some professors are guilty of great sin in remaining in the communion of Popish churches, where God is as much dishonoured as in Rome herself, only in a more crafty manner.</span></p>

Content beyond measure with his portion in the Lord his God, he had not a single desire with which to hunt after other gods; his cup was full, and his heart was full too; even in his sorest sorrows he still laid hold with both his hands upon his Father, crying, &quot;My God, my God ;&quot; he had not so much as a thought of falling down to worship the prince of this world, although tempted with an &quot;all these will I give thee.&quot; We, too, can make our boast in the Lord ; he is the meat and the drink of our souls. He is our portion, supplying all our necessities, and our cup yielding royal luxuries; our cup in this life, and our inheritance in the life to come. As children of the Father who is in heaven, we inherit, by virtue of our joint heirship with Jesus, all the riches of the covenant of grace ; and the portion which falls to us sets upon our table the bread of heaven and the new wine of the kingdom. Who would not be satisfied with such dainty diet? Our shallow cup of sorrow we may well drain with resignation, since the deep cup of love stands side by side with it, and will never be empty. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>maintainest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lot.&quot; </span>Some tenants have a covenant in their leases that they themselves shall maintain and uphold, but in our caje Jehovah himself maintains our lot. Our Lord Jesus delighted in this truth, that the Father was on his side, and would maintain his right against all the wrongs of men. He knew that his elect would be reserved for him, and that almighty power would preserve them as his lot and reward for ever. Let us also be glad, because the Judge of all the earth will vindicate our righteous cause.</p>

no other man was ever so thoroughly acquainted with grief, it is our belief that no other man ever experienced so much joy and delight in service, for no other served so faithfully and with such great results in view as his recompense of reward. The joy which was set before him must have sent some of its beams of splendour a-down the rugged places where he endured the cross, despising the shame, and must have made them in some respects pleasant places to the generous heait of the Redeemer. At any rate, we know that Jesus was well content with the blood-bought portion which the lines of electing love marked off as his spoil with the strong and his portion with the great. Therein he solaced himself on earth, and delights himself in heaven; and he asks no more &#39;&#8226; <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Goodly </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Heritage </span>&quot; than that his own beloved may be with him where he is and behold his glory. All the saints can use the language of this verse, and the more thoroughly they can enter into its contented, grateful, joyful spirit the better for themselves, and the more glorious to their God. Our Lord was poorer than we are, for he had not where to lay his head, and yet when he mentioned his poverty he never used a word of murmuring; discontented spirits are as unlike Jesus as the croaking raven is unlike the cooing dove. Martyrs have been happy in dungeons. &quot;From the delectable orchard of&#9632; the Leonine prison the Italian martyr dated his letter, and the presence of God made the gridiron of Laurence pleasant to him.&quot; Mr. Greenham was bold enough to say, &quot;They never felt God&#39;s love, or tasted forgiveness of sins, who are discontented.&quot; Some divines think that discontent was the first sin, the rock which wrecked our race in paradise; certainly there can be no paradise where this evil spirit has power, its slime will poison all the flowers of the garden.</span></p>

Read in confirmation of this, John vii. 16; viii. 28; and xii. 49, 50; and the prophecy concerning him in Isaiah xi. 2, 3. It was our Redeemer&#39;s wont to repair to his Father for direction, and having received it, he blessed him for giving him counsel. It would be well for us if we would follow his example of lowliness, cease from trusting in our own understanding, and seek to be guided by the Spirit of God. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>My </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>reins </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>aim </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>instruet </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>night </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>seasons.&#39;&#39; </span>By the reins understand the inner man, the affections and feelings. The communion of the soul with God brings to it an inner spiritual wisdom which in still seasons is revealed to itself. Our Redeemer spent many nights alone upon the mountain, and we may readily conceive that together with his fellowship with heaven, he carried on a profitable commerce with himself; reviewing his experience, forecasting his work, and considering his position. Great generals fight their battles in their own mind long before the trumpet sounds, and so did our Lord win our battle on his knees before he gained it on the cross. It is a gracious habit after taking counsel from above to take counsel within. Wise men see more with their eyes shut by night than fools can see by day with their eyes open. He who learns from God and so gets the seed, will soon find wisdom within himself growing in the garden of his soul; &quot;Thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left.&quot; The night season which the sinner chooses for his sins is the hallowed hour of quiet when believers hear the soft still voices of heaven, and of the heavenly life within themselves.</p>

Then hope shone full upon our Lord&#39;s soul, and, as recorded in these verses, he surveyed the future with holy confidence because he had a continued eye to Jehovah, and enjoyed his perpetual presence. He felt that, thus sustained, he could never be driven from his life&#39;s grand design ; nor was he, for he stayed not his hand till he could say, &quot;It is finished.&quot; What an infinite mercy was this for us! In this immoveableness, caused by simple faith in the divine help, Jesus is to be viewed as our exemplar; to recognize the presence of the Lord is the duty of every believer; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>set </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>always </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>before </span>m&#171;/&quot; and to <span style='font-style:italic;'>trust </span>the Lord as our champion and guard is the privilege of every saint; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>beeause </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>right </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hand, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moved.&#39;&#39; </span>The apostle translates this passage, &quot;I foresaw the Lord always before my face;&quot; Acts ii. 25 ; the eye of Jesus&#39; faith could discern beforehand the continuance of divine support to his suffering Son, in such a degree that he should never be moved from the accomplishment of his purpose of redeeming his people. By the power of God at his right hand he foresaw that he should smite through all who rose up against him, and on that power he placed the firmest reliance. He clearly foresaw that he must die, for he speaks of his flesh resting, and of his soul in the abode of separate spirits; death was full before his face, or he would not have mentioned corruption; but such was his devout reliance upon his God, that he sang over the tomb, and rejoiced in vision of the sepulchre, IIe knew that the visit of his soul to Sheol, or the invisible world of disembodied spirits, would be a very short one, and that his body in a very brief space would leave the grave, uninjured by its sojourn there; all this made him say, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glad,&#39;&#39; </span>and moved his tongue, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>glory </span>of his frame, to <span style='font-style:italic;'>rejoice </span>in God, the strength of his salvation. Oh, for such holy faith in the prospect of trial and of death! It is the woik of faith, not merely to create a peace which passeth all understanding, but to fill the heart full of gladness until the tongue, which, as the organ of an intelligent creature, is our glory, bursts forth in notes of harmonious praise. Faith gives us living joy, and bestows dying rest. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Myflenh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>also </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hope.&#39;&#39; </span></p>

He who in soul and body was pre-eminently God&#39;s &quot; Holy One,&#39;&#39; was loosed from the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. This is noble encouragement to all the saints; die they must, but rise they shall, and though in their case they shall see corruption, yet they shall rise to everlasting life. Christ&#39;s resurrection is the cause, the earnest, the guarantee, and the emblem of the rising of all his people. Let them, therefore, go to their graves as to their beds, resting their flesh among the clods as they now do upon their couches.</p>

According to some, it is derived from a verb which means <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hide, </span>and denotes a mystery or secret. Those who adopt this view, regard the title as indicating a depth of doctrinal and spiritual import in the Psalm, which neither the writer nor any of his contemporaries had fathomed. According to others, it is derived from a verb which means <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cut, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grave, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>write, </span>and denotes simply a writing of David. With this view agree the Chaldee and Septuagint versions, the former translating it, &quot;a straight sculpture of David:&quot; and the latter, &quot;an inscription upon a pillar to David.&quot; Others again, look upon <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Michtam,&quot; </span>as being derived from a noun which means gold, and they understand it as denoting a golden Psalm&#8212;a Psalm of surpassing excellence, and worthy of being written in letters of gold.

I had met with disappointments in the world; and then, perhaps, I cried, Thou art my portion, O Lord. Or, perhaps, when I was under serious impressions, in the hurry of my spirits, I might look up to God and say, Thou art my Lord. But, whatever I could or did formerly say, I am certain that I cannot say it at present.&quot; Have none of you thought in this manner <span style='font-style:italic;'>\ </span>I will hazard one conjecture more; and I doubt not but in this case I shall guess rightly. When I repeated these words, &quot;O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord ;&quot; &quot;So have I,&quot; thought one; &quot;So have I,&quot; thought another; I have said it often, but I said it with peculiar solemnity and pleasure, when, in an act of humble devotion, I lately threw my ransomed, rescued, grateful soul at his feet, and cried, &quot;O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant; thou hast loosed my bonds.&quot; The very recollection of it is pleasant; and I shall now have an opportunity of renewing my vows, and hope to recover something of the divine serenity and joy which I at that time experienced.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Laviiigton<sup>,</sup>s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermons, </span>1810.</p>

Whatsoever others have, they have not for their own private use, but that by them, as by pipes and conduits, they liberally should be conveyed unto me also. Wherefore in this strain we are taught, that if we be the children of God, we must join ourselves in a holy league to his people, and by mutual participation of the gifts of God, we must testify each to other, that we be of the number and communion of saints; and this is an undoubted badge and cognizance of him that loveth God, if he also loveth them that are begotten of God. Wherefore, if we so profess ourselves to be of God and to worship him, then we must join ourselves to the church of God which with us doth worship God. And this must we do of necessity, for it is a branch of our belief that there is a communion of saints in the church; and if we believe that there is a God, we must also believe that there is a remnant of people, unto whom God revealeth himself, and communicateth his mercies, in whom we must have all our delight, to whom we must communicate according to the measure of grace given unto every one of us.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Greenham. </span></p>
