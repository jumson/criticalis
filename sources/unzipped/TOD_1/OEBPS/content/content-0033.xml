What is man, that he should have a sun, moon, and stars, planted in the firmament for him? What creature is this? When great preparations are m ide in any place, much provisions laid in, and the house adorned with richest furnitures, we say, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>What </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>this </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>such </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>?&quot; </span>When such a goodly fabric was raised up, the goodly house of the world adorned aud furnished, we have reason admiringly to say, What is this man that must be the tenant or inhabitant of this house? There is yet a higher exaltation of man in the creation; man was magnified with the stamp of God&#39;s image, one part whereof the psalmist describes in the sixth verse, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>modest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dominion </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>over </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>put </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>under </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>feet,&#39;&#39; </span>etc. Thus man was magnified in creation. What was man that he should have the rule of the world given him? That he should bo lord over the fish of the sea, and over the beasts of the field, and over the fowls of the air? Again, man was magnified in creation, in that God set him in the next degree to the angels; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Tlulu </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>little </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lower </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>angels </span>/&quot; there is the first part of the answer to this question, man was magnified in being made so excellent a creature, and in having so many excellent creatures made for him. All which m:iy be understood of man as created in God&#39;s image; but since the transgression it is peculiar to Christ, as the apostle applies it (Heb. ii.

Thus, in the matter of spirituality, he is the best gentleman that is the best Christian. The men of Berea, who received the word with all readiness, were more noble than those of Thessalonica. The burgesses of God&#39;s city be not of base lineage, but truly noble; they boast not of their generation, but their regeneration, which is far better; for, by their second birth they are the sons of God, and the church is their mother, and Christ their elder brother, the Holy Ghost their tutor, angels their attendants, and all other creatures their subjects, the whole world their inn, and heaven their home. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Spencer&#39;s </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>New </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Old.&#39;&#39; </span></p>

With a holy resolution the songster begins his hymn; <span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>O </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord. </span>It sometimes needs all our determination to face the foe, and bless the Lord in the teeth of his enemies ; vowing that whoever else may be silent <span style='font-style:italic;'>we </span>will bless his name; here, however, the overthrow of the foe is viewed as complete, and the song flows with sacred fulness of delight. It is our duty to praise the Lord ; let us perform it as a privilege. Observe that David&#39;s praise is all given to the Lord. Praise is to be offered to God alone; we may be grateful to the intermediate agent, but our thanks must have long wings and mount aloft to heaven. <span style='font-style:italic;'>With </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whole </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart. </span>Half heart is no heart. <span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>show </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forth. </span>There is true praise in the thankful telling forth to others of our heavenly Father&#39;s &#8226;dealings with us; this is one of the themes upon which the godly should speak often to one another, and it will not be casting pearls before swine if we make even the ungodly hear of the loving-kindness of the Lord to us. <span style='font-style:italic;'>All </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>marvellous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works. </span>Gratitude for one mercy refreshes the memory as to thousands of others. One silver link in the chain draws up a long series of tender remembrances. Here is eternal work for us, for there can be no end to the showing forth of <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>his deeds of love. If we consider our own sinfulness and nothingness, wo must feel that every work of preservation, forgiveness, conversion, deliverance, sanctification, &amp;c., which the Lord has wrought for us, or in us is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>marvellous </span>work. Even in heaven, divine loving-kindness will doubtless be as much a theme of surprise as of rapture.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA108.w.1.5.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.125.1.5.box.258.1415.1292.853.q.60'>2. Gladness and joy are the appropriate spirit in which to praise the goodness of the Lord. Birds extol the Creator in notes of overflowing joy, the cattle low forth his praise with tumult of happiness, and the fish leap up in his worship with excess of delight. Moloch may be worshipped with shrieks of pain, and Juggernaut may be honoured by dying groans and inhuman yells, but he whose name is Love is best pleased with the holy mirth, and sanctified gladness of his people. Daily rejoicing is an ornament to the Christian character, and a suitable robe for God&#39;s choristers to wear. God loveth a <span style='font-style:italic;'>cheerful </span>giver, whether it be the gold of his purse or the gold of his mouth which he presents upon his altar. <span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>O </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>most </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>High. </span>Songs are the fitting expressions of inward thankfulness, and it were well if we indulged ourselves and honoured our Lord with more of them. Mr. B. P. Power nas well said, &quot;The sailors give a cheery cry as they weigh anchor, the ploughman whistles in the morning as he drives his team ; the milkmaid sings her rustic song as she sets about her early task; when soldiers are leaving friends behind them, they do not march out to the tune of the &#39; Dead March in Saul,&#39; but to the quick notes of some lively air. A praising spirit would do for us all that their songs and music do for them ; and if only we could determine to praise the Lord, we should surmount many a difficulty which our low spirits never would have been equal to, and we should do double the work which can be clone if the heart be languid in its beating, if we be crushed and trodden down in soul. As the evil spirit in Saul yielded in the olden time to the influence of the harp of the son of Jesse, so would the spirit of melancholy often take flight from us, if only we would take up the song of praise.&quot;</p>

God&#39;s presence is evermore sufficient to work the defeat of our most furious foes, and their ruin is so complete when the Lord takes them in hand, that even flight cannot save them, they fall to rise no more when he pursues them. We<a id='GBS.PA109.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.126.1.0.box.221.301.1297.134.q.60'>
must be careful, like David, to give all the glory to him whose presence gives the victory. If we have here the exultings of our conquering Captain, let us make the triumphs of the Redeemer the triumphs of the redeemed, and rejoice with him at the total discomfiture of all his foes.</span></p>

God rebukes before he destroys, but when he once comes to blows with the wicked he ceases not until he has dashed them in pieces so small that their very name is forgotten, and like a noisome snuff their remembrance is put out for ever and ever.

He who gives no quarter to the wicked in the day of judgment, is the defence and refuge of his saints in the day of trouble. There are many forms of oppression ; both from man and from Satan oppression comes to us; and for all its forms, a refuge is provided in the Lord Jehovah. There were cities of refuge under the law, God is our refuge-city under the gospel. As the ships whtn vexed with tempest make for harbour, so do the oppressed hasten to the wings of a just and gracious God. IIe is a high tower so impregnable, that the hosts of hell cannot carry it by storm, and from its lofty heights faith looks down with scorn upon her enemies.</p>

Ignorance is worst when it amounts to ignorance of God, and knowledge is best when it exercises itself upon <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span>of God. This most excellent knowledge leads to the most excellent grace of faith. O, to learn more of the attributes and character of God. Unbelief, that hooting nighthird, cannot live in the light of divine knowledge, it flies before the sun of God&#39;s great and gracious name. If we read this verse literally, there is, no doubt, a glorious fulness of assurance in the names of God. We have recounted them in the &quot; Hints for Preachers,&#39;&#39; and would direct the reader&#39;s attention to them. By knowing his name is also meant an experimental acquaintance with the attributes of God, which are everyone of them anchors to hold the soul from drifting in seasons of peril.

Being full of gratitude himself, our inspired author is eager to excite others to join the strain, and praise God in the same manner as he had himself vowed to do in the first and second verses. The heavenly spirit of praise is gloriously contagious, and he that hath it is never content unless he can excite all who surround him to unite in his sweet employ. Singing and preaching, as means of glorifying God, are hero joined together, and it is remarkable that, connected with all revivals of gospel ministry, there has been a sudden outhurst of the spirit of song. Luther&#39;s Psalmi and Hymns were in all men&#39;s mouths, and in the modern revival under Wesley and Whitefield, the strains of Charles Wesley, Cennick, Berridge, Toplady, Hart, Newton, and many others, were the outgrowth of restored piety. The singing of the birds of praise fitly accompanies the return of the gracious spring of divine visitation through the proclamation of the truth. Sing on brethren, and preach on, and these shall both be a token that the Lord still dwelleth in Zion. It will be well for us when coming up to Zion, to remember that the Lord dwells among his saints, and is to be had in peculiar reverence of all those that are about him.</p>

When an inquest is held concerning the blood of the oppressed, the martyred saints will have the first remembrance; he will avenge his own elect. Those saints who are living shall also be heard; they shall be exonerated from blame, and kept from destruction, even when the Lord&#39;s most terrible work is going on ; the man with the inkhorn by his side shall mark them all for safety, before the slaughtermen are permitted to smite the Lord&#39;s enemies. The humble cry of the poorest saints shall neither be drowned by the voice of thundering justice nor by the shrieks of the condemned.</p>

In sickness, in sin, in despair, in temptation, we have been brought very low, and the gloomy portal has seemed as if it would open to imprison us, but, underneath us were the everlasting arms, and, therefore, we have been uplifted even to the gates of heaven. Trapp quaintly says, &quot; He commonly reserveth his hand for a dead lift, and rescueth those who were even talking of their graves.&quot; We must not overlook David&#39;s object in desiring mercy, it is God&#39;s glory: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>show </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>forth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>Saints are not so selfish as to look only to self; they desire mercy&#39;s diamond that they may let others see it flash and spaikle, and may admire Him who gives such priceless gems to his beloved. The contrast between the gates of death and the gates of the New Jerusalem is very striking; let our songs be excited to the highest and most rapturous pitch by the double consideration of whence we are taken, and to what we have been advanced, and let our prayers for mercy be made more energetic and agonizing by a sense of the grace which such a salvation implies. When David speaks of his showing forth <span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>God&#39;s praise, he means that, in his deliverance grace in all its heights and depths would be magnified.

A ruler who winked at evil would soon be known by all his subjects to be evil himself, and he, on the other hand, who is severely just in judgment reveals his own nature thereby. So long as our God is God, he will not, he cannot spare the guilty; except through that one glorious way in which he is just, and yet the justifier ot him that belicveth in Jesus. We must notice, secondly, that the manner of his judgment is singularly wise, and indisputably just. He makes the wicked become their own executioners. &quot;The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made,&quot; &amp;c. Like cunning hunters they prepared a pitfall for the godly and fell into it themselves: the foot of the victim &#39;escnped their crafty snares, but the toils surrounded themselves: the cruel snare was laboriously manufactured, and it proved its efficacy by snaring its own maker. Persecutors and oppressors are often ruined by their own malicious projects. &quot;Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves;&quot; the contentious are involved in ruinous costs; the vicious are devoured with fierce diseases; the envious eat their own hearts; and blasphemers curse their own souls. Thus, men may read their sin in their punishment. They sowed the seed of sin, and the ripe fruit of damnation is the natural result.</span></p>

In which words are opened the subject of this Psalm : that is, that he therein sings the marvellous works of God. And these works are wonderful, because he converts, by those who are nothing, those who have all things, and, by the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Almutii </span>who live in hidden faith, and are dead to the world, he humbles those who flourish in glory, and are looked upon in the world. Thus accomplishing such mighty things without force, without arms, without labour, by the cross only and blood. But how will his saying, that he will show forth <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;all&quot; </span>his marvellous works, agree with that of Job ix. 10, &quot;which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number &quot;? For, who can show forth all the marvellous works of God? We may say, therefore, that these things are spoken in that excess of feeling in which he said (Psalm vi. 6), &quot;I will water my couch with my tears.&quot; That is, he hath such an ardent desire to speak of the wonderful works of God, that, as far as his wishes are concerned, he <span style='font-style:italic;'>would </span>set the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;all&quot; </span>forth, though he <span style='font-style:italic;'>could </span>not do it, for love has neither bounds nor end : and, as Paul saith (1 Cor. xiii. 7), &quot;Love beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things;&quot; hence it can do nil things, and does do all things, for God looketh at the heart and spirit.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Martin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luther. </span></p>

A blind faith is as bad as a dead faith: that eye may as well be said to be a good eye which is without sight, as that faith is good without knowledge. Devout ignorance damns; which condemns the church of Rome, that think it a piece of their religion to be kept in ignorance; these set up an altar to an unknown God. They say ignorance is the mother of devotion ; but sure where the sun is set in the understanding, it must needs be night in the affections. So necessary is knowledge to the being of faith, that the Scriptures do sometimes baptise faith with the name of knowledge.

It will much increase the torment of the damned, in that their torments will be as large and strong as their understandings and affections, which will cause those violent passions to be still working. Were their loss never so great, and their sense of it never so passionate, yet if they could but lose the use of their memory, those passions would die, and that loss being forgotten, would little trouble them. But as they cannot lay by their life and being, though then they would account annihilation a singular mercy, so neither can they lay aside any part of their being. Understanding, conscience, affections, memory, must all live to torment them, which should have helped to their happiness. And as by these they should have fed upon the love of God, and drawn forth perpetually the joys of his presence, so by these must they now feed upon the wrath of God, and draw forth continually the dolours of his absence. Therefore, never think, that when I say the hardness of their hearts, and their blindness, dulness, and forgetfulness shall be removed, that therefore they arc more holy and happy than befuro: no, but morally more vile, and hereby far more miserable. Oh, how many times did God by his messengers here call upon them, &quot; Sinners, consider whither you are going. Do but make a stand awhile, and think where your way will end, what is the offered glory that you so carelessly reject: will not this be bitterness in the end?&quot; And yet, these men would never be brought to consider.

Ah ! but then they shall have leisure enough, they shall be where they shall have nothing else to do but consider it: their memories shall have no other employment to hinder them; it shall even be engraven upon the tables of their hearts.

And I may give you an account in three particulars why the Lord will sometimes do justice in the place of beholders, or in the open sight of others. First, that there may be witnesses enough of what he doth, and so a record of it be kept, at least in the minds and memories of faithful men for the generations to come. Secondly, the Lord doth it not only that he may have witnesses of his justice, but also that his justice and the proceedings of it, may have an effect and a fruit upon those who did not feel it, nor fall under it. This was the reason why the Lord threatened to punish Jerusalem in the sight of the nations. Ezek. v. 6,</p>

Thirdly, God strikes some wicked men in open view, or in the place of beholders for the comfort of his own people, and for their encouragement. Psalm lviii. 10, 11. &quot;.The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance ;&quot; not that he shall be glad of the vengeance, purely as it is a hurt or a suffering to the creature; but the righteous shall be glad when he seeth the vengeance of God as it is a fulfilling of the threatening of God against the sin of man, and an evidence of his own holiness It is said (Exod. xiv. 30, 31), that God having over</p>

This dependence of a soul undoubtedly will awaken ths almighty power of God for such a one&#39;s defence. He hath sworn the greatest oath that can come out of his blessed lips, even by himself, that such as thus fly for refuge to hope in him, shall have strong consolation. Heb. vi. 17. This indeed may give the saint the greater boldness of faith to expect kind entertainment when he repairs to God for refuge, because he cannot come before he is looked for ; God having set up his name and promises as a strong tower, both calls his people into these chambers and expects they should betake themselves thither. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

When trial and desertion come together, we are in as perilous a plight as Paul, when his ship fell into a place where two seas met (Acts xxvii. 41). It is but little wonder if we are like the vessel which ran aground, and the fore-part stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, while the hinder part was broken by the violence of the waves. When our sun is eclipsed, it is dark indeed. If we need an answer to the question, &quot;Why hidest thou thyself?&quot; it is to be found in the fact that there is a &quot; needs-be,&quot; not only for trial, but for heaviness of heart under trial (1 Pet. i. 6) ; but how could this be the case, if the Lord should shine upon us while he is afflicting us? Should the parent comfort his child while he is correcting him, where would be the use of the chastening? A smiling face and a rod are not fit companions. God bares the back that the blow may be felt; for it is <span style='font-style:italic;'>oa]yfelt </span>affliction which can become <span style='font-style:italic;'>blest </span>affliction.

The indictment being read, and the petition presented, the evidence is now heard upon the flrst count. The evidence is very full and conclusive upon the matter of <span style='font-style:italic;'>pride, </span>and no jury could hesitate to give a verdict against the prisoner at the bar. Let us, however, hear the witnesses one by one. The first testifies that he is a boaster. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wicked </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>boasteth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>desire.&quot; </span>He is a very silly boaster, for he glories in a mere desire: a very brazen-faced boaster, for that desire is villainy; and a most abandoned sinner, to boast of that which is his shame. Bragging sinners are the worst and most contemptible of men, especially when their filthy desires, &#8212;too filthy to be carried into act,&#8212;become the theme of their boastings. When Mr. Hate-Good and Mr. Heady are joined in partnership, they drive a brisk trade in the devil&#39;s wares. This one proof is enough to condemn the prisoner at the bar. Take him away, jailor! But stay, another witness desires to bo sworn and heard. This time, the impudence of the proud rebel is even more apparent; for he &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>blesseth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>covetous, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>whom </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>abhorreth.&quot; </span>This is insolence, which is pride unmasked. He is haughty enough to differ from the Judge of all the earth, and bless the men whom God hath cursed.

We say it with sorrow, there are many professors of religion who esteem a rich man, and flatter him, even though they know that he has fattened himself upon the flesh and blood of the poor. The only sinners who are received as respectable are covetous men. If a man is a fornicator, or a drunkard, we put him out of the church; but who ever read of church discipline against that idolatrous wretch,&#8212;the covetous man? Let us tremble, lest we be found to be partakers of this atrocious sin of pride, &quot; blessing the covetous, whom Jehovah abhorreth.&quot;</p>

It is an admirable arrangement that the heart is often written on the countenance, just as the motion of the wheels of a clock find their record on its face. A brazen face and a broken heart never go together. We are not quite sure that the Athenians were wise when they orduined that men should be tried in the dark lest their countenances should weigh with the judges; for there is much more to be learned from the motions of the muscles of the face than from the words of the lips. Honesty shines in the face, but villainy peeps out at the eyes.</p>

The fact that the man is proud and arrogant may go a long way to prove that he is vindictive and cruel. Haman&#39;a pride was the father of a cruel design to murder all the Jews.

We may at once perceive that this is intended to be another urgent plea with the Lord to show his power, and reveal his justice. When the wicked call God&#39;s righteousness in question, we may well beg him to teach them terrible things in righteousness. In verse 13, the hope of the infidel and his heart-wishes are laid bare.

So that, if in any respect there has not been enough said heretofore, or if there shall be anything wanting in the Psalms that shall follow, we may here find a perfect image and representation of iniquity. This Psalm, therefore, is a type, form, and description of that man, who, though he may be in the sight of himself and of men more excellent than Peter himself, is detestable in the eyes of God ; and this it was that moved Augustine, and those who followed him, to understand the Psalm of <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Antichiust. </span>But as the Psalm is without a title, let us embrace the most general and common understanding of it (as I said), and let us look at the picture of ungodliness which it sets before us.

Compared with the regular and quiet diligence of our fathers, and their contentment with small but sure returns, the wild and wide-spread speculation for great gains, the rash and hasty adventures which are daily made, and the desperate gamester-like risks which are run, do reveal full surely that a spirit of covetousness hath been poured out upon men within the last thirty or forty years. And the providence of God corresponding thereto, by wonderful and unexpected revolutions, by numerous inventions for manufacturing the productions of the earth, in order to lead men into temptation, hath impressed upon the whole face of human affairs, a stamp of earnest worldliness not known to our fathers: insomuch that our youth do enter life no longer with the ambition of providing things honest in the sight of men, keeping their credit, bringing up their family, and realising a competency, if the Lord prosper them, but with the ambition of making a fortune, retiring to their ease, and enjoying the luxuries of the present life. Against which crying sin of covetousness, dearly beloved brethren, I do most earnestly call upon you to wage a good warfare. This place is its seat, its stronghold, even this metropolitan city of Christian Britain ; and ye who are called by the grace of God out of the great thoroughfare of Mammon, are so elected for the express purpose of testifying against this and all other the backslidings of the church planted here; and especially against this, as being in my opinion, one of the most evident and the most common of them all.

I must indeed correct myself, men are willing to be justified, but they would have their duties to purchase their peace and the favour of God. Thousands will die and be damned rather than they will have a pardon upon the sole account of Christ&#39;s merits and obedience. Oh, the cursed pride of the heart! When will men cease to be wiser than God? To limit God? When will men be contented with God&#39;s way of saving them by the blood of the everlasting covenant? How dare men thus to prescribe to the infinitely wise God? Is it not enough for thee that thy destruction is of thyself? But must thy salvation be of thyself too? Is it not enough that thou hast wounded thyself, but wilt thou die for ever, rather than be beholden to a plaister of fiee grace? Wilt be damned unless thou mayest be thine own Saviour? God is willing (&quot; God so loved the world that he gave his only Son&quot;), art thou so proud as that thou wilt not be beholden to God? Thou wilt deserve, or have nothing. What shall I say? Poor thou art, and yet proud ; thou hast nothing but wretchedness and misery, and yet thou art talking of a purchase. This is a provocation. &quot;God resisteth the proud,&quot; especially the spiritually proud. He that is proud of his clothes and parentage, is not so contemptible in God&#39;s eyes as he that is proud of his abilities, and so scorns to submit to God&#39;s methods for his salvatfon by Christ, and by his righteousness alone. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Lewis </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stuckley. </span></p>

This knowledge it prevents them from seeking in various ways. In the first place, it renders God a disagreeable object of contemplation to the wicked, and a knowledge of him as undesirable. Pride consists in an unduly exalted opinion of one&#39;s self. It is, therefore, impatient of a rival, hates a superior, and cannot endure a master. In proportion as it prevails in the heart, it makes us wish to see nothing above us, to acknowledge no law but our own wills, to follow no rule but our own inclinations. Thus it led Satan to rebel against his Creator, and our first parents to desire to be as gods. Since such are the effects of pride, it is evident that nothing can be more painful to a proud heart than the thoughts of such a being as God ; one who is infinitely powerful, just, and holy ; who can neither be resisted, deceived, nor deluded ; who disposes, according to his own sovereign pleasure, of all creatures and events; and who, in an especial manner, hates pride, and ia determined to abase and punish it. Such a being pride can contemplate only with feelings of dread, aversion, and abhorrence. It must look upon him as its natural enemy, the great enemy, whom it has to fear. But the knowledge of God directly tends to bring this infinite, irresistible, irreconcilable enemy full to the view of the proud man. It teaches him that he has a superior, a master, from whose authority he cannot escape, whose power he cannot resist, and whose will he must obey, or be crushed before him, and be rendered miserable for ever. It shows him what he hates to see, that, in despite of his opposition, God&#39;s counsel shall stand, that he will do all his pleasure, and that in all things wherein men deal proudly, God is above them. These truths torture the proud unhumbled hearts of the wicked, and hence they hate that knowledge of God which teaches these truths, and will not seek it. On the contrary, they wish to remain ignorant of such a being, and to banish all thoughts of him from their minds. With this view, they neglect, pervert, or explain away those passages of revelation which describe God&#39;s true character, and endeavour to believe that he is altogether such a one aa themselves.</p>

It plunged Satan from heaven into hell ; it banished our tirbt parents fiom paradise; and it will, in a similar manner, ruin all who indulge in it. It keeps us in ignorance of God, shuts us out from his favour, prevents us from resembling him, deprives us in this world of all the honour and happiness which communion with him would confer; and in the next, unless previously hated, repented of, and renounced, will bar for ever against us the door of heaven, and close upon us the gates of hell.

He takes not him along with him, no more than if he were no God ; the thoughts of him and his will sway him not. As you use to say, when a combination of men leave out some one they should advise with, that such a one is not of their counsel, is not in the plot; so nor is God in their purposes and advisings, they do all without him. But this is not all the meaning, but farther, all their thought is, that there is no God. This is there made the bottom, the foundation, the groundwork and reason of all their wicked plots and injurious projects, and deceitful carriages and proceedings, that seeing there is no God or power above them to take notice of it, to regard or requite them, therefore they may be bold to go on.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Goodwin. </span></p>

Many of the heathens and others, have denied that there is a God, yet when they were in distress, they did fall down and confess him, as Diagoras, that grand atheist, when he was troubled with the strangullion, acknowledged a deity which he had denied.

The covenant of grace engageth the whole heart to God, and bars anything else from engrossing it; but what sti angers are God and the souls of most men! Though we have the knowledge of him by creation, yet he is for the most part an unknpwn God in the relations wherein he stands to us, because a God undelighted in.

The wits of men hang the wing when they come to exercise their reasons and fancies ubout God.

Poinpey, when he had in vain assaulted a city, and could not take it by force, devised this stratagem in way of agreement; he told them he would leave the siege and make peace with them, upon condition that they would let in a few weak, sick, and wounded soldiers among them to be cured. They let in the soldiers, and when the city was secure, the soldiers let in Pompey&#39;s army. A carnal settled security will let in a whole army of lusts into the soul.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Brooks. </span></p>

All on a sudden, in the wide ocean, the sea becomes calm, the surface of the water clear as a crystal, smooth us glass&#8212;the air serene; the unskilled passenger becomes tranquil and happv, but the old mariner trembles. In an instant the waves froth, the winds murmur, the heavens kindle, a thousand gulfs open, a frightful light inflames the air, and every wave threatens sudden death.
