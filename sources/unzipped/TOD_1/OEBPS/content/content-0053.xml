And in that they looked three and three together, they did represent the blessed Trinity. Not only teaching all nations, but also in that sea of water, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Wherefore, though the two kine which carried the ark wherein were the tables of the law, went straight and kept one path, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left; yet these twelve oxen which carried the molten sea, signifying the doctrine of the gospel, went not straight, neither kept one path, but turned into the way of the Gentiles; yea, they looked all manner of ways, east, west, north, and south. And those two kjne stood still and lowed no more when they came to the field of Joshua, dwelling in Bethshemesh, that is, the house of the sun. To note, that all the kine, and calves, and sacrifices, and ceremonies of the old law were to cease and stand still when they came to Jesus, who is the true Joshua, dwelling in heaven, which is the true Bethshemesh. But .these twelve oxen were so far from leaving off, either to go, or to low, when they came to Christ, that even then they went much faster and lowed much louder; so that now &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sound </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gone </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lands, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>^words </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>end </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>world</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>;&quot; </span>and &quot;in <span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Qod</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;set&quot; </span>Bethshemesh, that is, a house or <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>&quot;</sup></span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tabernacle </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sun.&quot; </span>Therefore, as the material sun, through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, goeth forth from the uttermost parts of the heaven, and runneth about to the end of it again : in like sort, the spiritual <span style='font-style:italic;'>Sun </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Righteousness, </span>by the twelve apostles, as by twelve signs, hath been borne round about the world, that he might be not only &quot; the glory of his people Israel,&quot; but also &quot; a light to lighten the Gentiles;&quot; and that all, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>the ends of the earth might see the salvation of our God.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Playfere. </span></p>

The times of the Old Testament are times of night in comparison of the gospel day, and are so represented in Scripture, and therefore the approach of the day of the New Testament dispensation in the birth of Christ, is called the day-spring from on high visiting the earth (Luke i. 78), &quot;Through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us;&quot; and the commencing of the gospel dispensation as it was introduced by Christ, is called the Sun of Righteousness rising. Mai. iv. 8. But this gospel dispensation commences with the resurrection of Christ. Therein the Sun of Righteousness rises from under the earth, as the sun appears to do in the morning, and comes forth as a bridegroom. He rose as the joyful, glorious bridegroom of his church ; for Christ, especially as risen again, is the proper bridegroom, or husband, of his<a id='GBS.PA319.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.336.1.0.box.209.309.1301.922.q.60'>
church, as the apostle teaches (Rom. vii. 4), &quot;Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.&quot; He that was covered with contempt, and overwhelmed in a deluge of sorrow, has purchased and won his spouse, for he loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might present it to himself; now he comes forth as a bridegroom to bring home his purchased spouse to him in spiritual marriage, as he soon after did in the conversion of such multitudes, making his people willing in the day of his power, and hath also done many times since, and will do in a yet more glorious degree. And as the sun when it rises comes forth like a bridegroom gloriously adorned, so Christ in his resurrection entered on his state of glory. After his state of sufferings, he rose to shine forth in ineffable glory as the King of heaven and earth, that he might be a glorious bridegroom, in whom his church might be unspeakably happy. Here the psalmist says that God <span style='font-style:italic;'>has </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>placed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tabernacle </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sun </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heavens</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>so God the Father had prepared an abode in heaven for Jesus Christ; he had set a throne for him there, to which he ascended after he rose. The sun after it is risen ascends up to the midst of heaven, and then at that end of its race descends again to the earth; so Christ when he rose from the grave ascended up to the height of heaven, and far above all heavens, but at the end of the gospel day will descend again to the earth. It is here said that the risen sun &quot; rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.&quot; So Christ, when he rose, rose as a man of war, as the &#39;Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle; he rose to conquer his enemies, and to show forth his glorious power in subduing all things to himself, during that race which he had to run, which is from his resurrection to the end of the world, when he will return to the earth</span></p>

The earth receives its heat from the sun, and by conduction, a part of it enters the crust of our globe. By convection, another portion is cairied to the atmosphere, which it warms. Another portion is radiated into space, according to laws yet imperfectly understood, but which are evidently connected with the colour, chemical composition, and mechanical structure of parts of the earth&#39;s surface. At the same time the ordinary state of the air, consisting of gases and vapour, modifies the heat rays and prevents scorching. Thus, the solar heat is equalised by the air. Nothing on earth or in air is</p>

Heat also is in bodies in a state which is not sensible, and is therefore called latent heat, or heat of fluidity, because it is regarded as the cause of fluidity in ponderable substances. It can fuse every substance it does not decompose below the melting point, as in the case of wood. Every gas may be regarded as consisting of heat, and some basis of ponderable matter, whose cohesion it overcomes, imparting a tendency to great expansion, when no external obstacle prevents, and this expansive tendency is their elasticity or tension. Certain gases have been liquified under great pressure, and extreme cold. Heat, also, at certain temperatures, causes the elasticity of vapours to overcome the atmospheric pressure which can no longer restrain them. An example of this is the boiling point of water; and, indeed, in every case the true instance is the boiling point. Philosophers are agreed that the affinity of heat for any ponderable substance is superior to all other forces acting upon it. No ponderable matters can combine without disengagement of heat. . . . And the same occurs from every mechanical pressure and condensation of a body. In all these cases, and many more, there are like evidences of the presence and influences of heat; but the facts now advanced are sufficient to show us tho force of the expression, that in terrestrial things nothing is hid from, or can by any possibility escape the agency of heat.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Edwin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sidney, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>A.M., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Conversations </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bilile </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Science,&#39;&#39; </span>1866.</p>

He not only enlightens the understanding, so that it shall see and know the truth; he also softens, and melts, and warms the heart, so that it shall love the truth, and calls forth fruit from it, and ripens the fruit he has called forth; and that too on the lowliest plant which creeps along the ground, as well as the</span></p>

Look, as a thing taken simply, would be poison and deadly in itself, yet mixed with other wholesome medicines, it is of great use, is an excellent physical ingredient; so the law is of great use as joined with the gospel, to awaken and startle the sinner,&#39; to show him his duty, to convince him of sin and judgment; but it is the gospel properly that pulls in the heart. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Manton. </span></p>

There are sins, some of &#39;which are committed when the sun shines&#8212;i.e., with light and knowledge; and then, as it is &#9632;w ith colours when the sun shines, you may see them; so these, a man can see, and know, and confess them particularly to be transgressions. There are other sins which are committed either in the times of ignorance, or else (if there be knowledge), yet with unobscrvonce. Either of these may bo so heaped up in the particular number of them, that as a man did when he did commit them, take no notice of them; so now, after the commission, if he should take the brightest candle to search all the records of his soul, yet many of them would escape his notice. And, indeed, this is a great part of our misery, that we cannot understand all our debts. We can easily see too many, yet many more lie, as it were, dead and out of sight. To sin is one great misery, and then to forget our sins is a misery too. If in repentance we could set the battle in array, point to every individual sin in the true and particular times of acting and re-acting, oh, how would our hearts be more broken with shame and sorrow, and how would we adore the richness of the treasure of mercy which must have a multitude in* it to pardon the multitude of our infinite errors and sins. But this is the coinfort; though we cannot understand every particular sin, or time of sinning, yet if we be not idle to search and cast over the books, and if we be heartily grieved <span style='font-style:italic;'>ior </span>these sins which we have found out, and can by true repentance turn from them unto God, nnd by faith unto the blood of Jesus Christ, 1 say that God, who knows our sins better than we can know them, and who understands the true intentions and dispositions of the heart&#8212;that if it did see the unknown sins it would be answerably carried against them&#8212;he will for his own mercy sake forgive them, and he, too, will not remember them. Nevertheless, though David saith, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>can </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>understand </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>errors?&quot; </span>as the prophet Jeremiah spake also, &quot;The heart of man is desperately wicked, who can know it?&quot; yet must we bestir ourselves at heaven to get more and more heavenly light, to find out more and more of our sinnings. So the Lord can search the heart; and, though we shall never be able to find out all our sins which we have committed, yet it is proper and beneficial for us to find out yet mOro sins than yet we do know. And you shall find these in your own experience ; that as soon ns ever grace entered your hearts, you saw sin in another way than you ever saw it before; yea, and the more grace hath traversed *ind increased in the soul, the more full discoveries hath it made of sins. It hath shown new sins as it were; new sins, not for their being, not as if they were not in the heart and life before, but for their evidence and our apprehension. We do now see such wages and such inclinations to be sinful which we did not think to bo so before. As physic brings those humours which had their residence before now more to the sense of the patient, or as the sun makes open the motes of dust which were in the room before, so doth the light of the word discover more corruption.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Obudiah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sedgwick. </span></p>

For, brethren, all the actings of sin are not without, they are not visible; but there are some, yea, the most dangerous actings within the soul, where corruption lies as a fountain and root. The heart of man is a scheme of wickedness; nay, a man saith that in his heart which he dares not speak with his tongue, and his thought will do that which his hands dare not to execute. Well, then, sin may be called &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>secret</span>&quot; when it is sin, and acted as sin, even there, where none but God and conscience can see. Methinks fin is like a candle in a lantern, where the shining is first within and then bursting out at the windows; or like evils and ulcerous humours, which are scabs and scurvy stuff, first within the skin, and afterwards they break out to the view on the outside. So it is with sin ; it is a malignant humour and a fretting leprosy, diffusing itself into several secret acts and workings within the mind, and then it breaks abroad and dares adventure the practice of itself to the eye of the world; and be it that it may never see the light, that it may be like a child born and buried in the womb, yet as that child is a man, a true man there closeted in that hidden frame of nature, so sin is truly sin, though it never gets out beyond the womb which did conceive and enliven it.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Obadiah </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sedgwick. </span></span></p>

Sinful acts are not only fruits of sin, but helps and strengths, all sinning being more sinful by more sinning, not only in the effects but in the cause: the spring and cause of sin will grow mad and insolent hereby, and more corrupt; this being a truth, that if the heart gives way for one sin, it will be ready for the next; if it will yield to bring forth once at the devil&#39;s pleasure, it will bring it forth twice by its own motion.

Secret sins bring fevered eyes and sleepless nights, until men burn out their consciences, and become in very deed ripe for the pit. Hypocrisy is a hard game to play at, for it is one deceiver against many observers; and for certain it is a miserable trade, which will earn at last, as its certain climax, a tremendous bankruptcy. Ah! ye who have sinned without discovery, &quot;Be sure your sin will find you out;&quot; and bethink you, it may find you out ere long. Sin, like murder, will come out; men will even tell tales about themselves in their dreams. God has made men to be so wretched in their consciences that they have been obliged to stand forth and confess the truth. Secret sinner! if thou wantest the foretaste of damnation upon earth, continue in thy secret sins; for no man is more miserable than he who sinneth secretly, and yet trieth to preserve a character. Yon stag, followed by the hungry hounds, with open mouths, is far more happy than the man who is pursued by his sins. Yon bird, taken in the fowler&#39;s net, and labouring to escape, is far more happy than he who hath weaved around himself a web of deception, and labours to escape from it, day by day making the toils more thick and the web moie strong.

Hence it is that the Scripture doth so often command that duty of <span style='font-style:italic;'>searching </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>trying, </span>of examining and communing with our hearts. Now what need were there of this duty, but that it is supposed many secret and subtle lusts lie lurking in our hearts, which we take no notice of? If then the godly would find out their hidden lusts, know the sins they not yet know, they must more impartially judge themselves; they must take time to survey and examine themselves; they must not in an overly and slight manner, but really and industriously look up and down as they would search for thieves; and they must again and again look into this dark corner, and that dark corner of their hearts, as the woman sought for the lost groat. This self-scrutiny, and self-judging, this winnowing and sifting of ourselves, is the only way to see what is chaff and what is wheat, what is mere refuse and what is enduring.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Anthony </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Burgess. </span></p>

From weakness to wilfulness, from ignorance to presumption, is its ordinary course and progress. The cloud that Elijah&#39;s man saw, was at first no bigger than a hand&#39;s-breadth, and it threatened no such thing as a general tempest; but yet, at last, it overspread the face of the whole heavens; so truly, a sin that at first ariseth in the soul but as a small mist, and is scarcely discernible; yet, if it be not scattered by the breath of prayer, it will at length overspread the whole life, and become most tempestuous and raging. And therefore, David, as one experienced in the deceitfulness of sin, doth thus digest and methodise his prayer: first against secret and lesser sins; and then against the more gross and notorious; as knowing the one proceeds and issues from the other : Lord, <span style='font-style:italic;'>cleanse </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>secret </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faults; </span>and this will be a most effectual means to preserve and <span style='font-style:italic;'>keep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servant </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sins.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Ezekiel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hopkins. </span></p>

Papists say that the man who doth a mortal sin is not in the state of grace; but for venials, a man may commit (in their divinity) who can tell how many of them, and yet be in Christ for all that! I hope there is no such meaning in any of our divines as to tie up men&#39;s consciences, to hang on such a distinction of sins; since it is beyond the wit of man to set down a distinct point between mortal and venial sins. Now when it is an impossible matter punctually to set down to the understanding of man which is, and which is not a venial sin, they must pardon me for giving the least way to such divinity as must needs leave the conscience of a man in a maze and labyrinth. I find that the nature of infirmities doth so depend upon circumstances, that that is an infirmity in one man which is a gross sin in another; and some men plead for themselves that the things they do are but infirmities. lie that <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span>sin, and when he hath done will say&#8212;not to comfort his soul against Satan, but&#8212;to flatter himself in his sin, that it is but an infirmity; for aught I know, he may go to hell for his infirmities. Besides, if that be good divinity, that a man who is in the state of grace may do infirmities, but not commit gross sins, then I would I could see a man that would undertake to find us out some rule out of the word, by which a sinner may find by his sin, when he is in Christ and when out of Christ; at what degrees of sinning&#8212;where lies the mathematical point and stop&#8212;that a man may say, &quot;Thus far may I go and yet be in grace; but if I step a step farther, then I am none of Christ&#39;s.&quot; We all know that sins have their latitude; and for a man to hang his conscience on such a distinction as hath no rule to define where the difference lies, is not safe divinity. The conscience on the rack will not be laid and said with forms and quiddities. The best and nearest<a id='GBS.PA331.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.348.1.0.box.206.315.1301.1062.q.60'>
way to quiet the heart of man is to say, that be the sin a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>infirmity </span>when we strive and strive but yield at last; or, of <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#8226;precipitancy, </span>when we be taken in haste, as he was who said in his haste, &quot;All men are liars;&quot; or, a mere <span style='font-style:italic;'>gross </span>sin in the matter: ay, say it be a <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span>sin, yet if we allow it not, it hinders not but we are in Christ, though we do with reluctaney act and commit it. And I say that we do resist it if we do not allow it. For let us not go about to deny that a godly man during his being a godly man may possibly commit <span style='font-style:italic;'>gross </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sins; </span>and for infirmities, if we allow them and like them that we know to be sins, then we do not resist them; and such a man who allows himself in one is guilty of all, and is none of Christ&#39;s as yet. Be the sin what it will, James makes no distinction; and, where the law distinguished not, we must not distinguish. I speak not of <span style='font-style:italic;'>doing </span>a sin, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>allowing</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>for a man may do it, and yet allow it not ; as in Paul (Rom. vii. 15, 16), &quot;That which I would not, that I do;&quot; and he that allows not sin doth resist it. Therefore, a man may resist it, hate it, and yet do it. All the difference that I know is this: 1. That a man may live after his conversion all his days, and yet never fall into a gross sin. By gross here I mean <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span>sins also. So David saith not &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>cleanse,&quot; </span>but &quot; <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Keep </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Back </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servant </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sins.&quot; </span>We may, then, be <span style='font-style:italic;'>kept </span>from them. I speak not that all are, but some be; and, therefore, in itself all might be. 2. For lesser sins, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;secret </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faults,&#39;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39; </span>we cannot live without them&#8212;they are of daily and almost hourly incursion; but yet we must be <span style='font-style:italic;'>cleansed </span>from them, as David speaks. Daily get your pardon; there is a pardon, of course, for them; they do not usually distract and plague the conscience, but yet we must not see them and allow them; if we do our case is to be pitied, wo are none of Christ&#39;s as yet. 3. Great staring sins a man cannot usually and commonly practise them, but he shall allow them. So Psalm xix. 13, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Keep </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>back </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servant </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sins; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>let </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dominion </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>over </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me,&quot; </span>implying that except we be kept back from them they will <span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dominion </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>over </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us. </span>It follows, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>then </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upright </span>/&quot; so that the man in whom <span style='font-style:italic;'>gross </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>or </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>or </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sins </span>have no <span style='font-style:italic;'>dominion, </span>he is an <span style='font-style:italic;'>tipright </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Capel. </span></span></p>

If the <span style='font-style:italic;'>under</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>standing </span>be most in fault, not apprehending that good it should, or not aright, the sin so done, though possibly it may have in it somewhat both of infirmity and presumption withal, is yet properly a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorance. </span>2. If the main fault be in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>affeetions, </span>through some sudden passion or perturbation of mind, blinding, or corrupting, or but outrunning the judgment&#8212;as of fear, anger, desire, joy, or any of the rest&#8212;the sin thence arising, though perhaps joined with some ignorance or presumption withal, is yet properly a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>infirmity. </span>But if the understanding be competently informed with knowledge, and not much blinded or transported with the incursion of any sudden, or violence of any vehement perturbation, so as the greatest blame must remain upon the untowardness of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>will, </span>resolvedly bent upon the evil, the sin arising from such <span style='font-style:italic;'>wilfulness, </span>though probably not free from all mixture of ignorance and infirmity withal, is yet properly <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wilful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presumption, </span>such a <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span>as we are now in treaty of. Rules are soonest learned and best remembered when illustrated with fit examples; and of such the rich storehouse of the Scripture affordeth us in each kind variety and choice enough, whence it shall suffice us to propose but one eminent of each sort. <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>men, </span>all of them for their holiness, of singular and worthy renown: David, St. Peter, and St. Paul. <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sins, </span>all of them for their matter, of the greatest magnitude : murdering of the innocent, abnegation of Christ, persecution of the church: Paul&#39;s persecution a grievous sin, yet a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorance</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>Peter&#39;s denial a grievous sin, yet a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>infirmity</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>David&#39;s murder, a far more grievous sin than either of both, because a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumption. </span>St. Paul, before his conversion, whilst he was Saul, persecuted and wasted the church of God to the utmost of his power, making havoc of the professors of Christ, entering into their very houses, and haling thence to prison, both men and women; and posting abroad with letters into remote quarters, to do all the mischief he could, everywhere with great fury, as if he had been mad, breathing out, wherever he came, nothing but threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. His <span style='font-style:italic;'>affeetions </span>were not set against them through any personal provocations, but merely out of zeal to the law; and surely his zeal had been good had it not been blind. Nor did his <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span>run cross to his judgment, but was led by it, for he &quot; verily thought in himself that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus;&quot; and verily his will had been good had it not been misled. But the error was in his <span style='font-style:italic;'>understanding, </span>his judgment being not yet actually convinced of the truth of the Christian religion. He was yet fully persuaded that Jesus was an impostor, and Christianity a pestilent sect, raised by Satan, to the disgrace and prejudice of Moses and the law. If these things had indeed been so, as he apprehended them, his <span style='font-style:italic;'>affections </span>and <span style='font-style:italic;'>will, </span>in seeking to root out such a sect, had been not only blameless but commendable. It was his erroneous judgment that poisoned all, and made that which otherwise had been zeal, to become persecution. But, however, the first discernible obliquity therein being in the <span style='font-style:italic;'>understanding, </span>that persecution of his was therefore a <span style='font-style:italic;'>sin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorance, </span>so called, and under that name condemned by himself. 1 Tim. i. 13. But such was not Peter&#39;s denial of his Master. He <span style='font-style:italic;'>knew </span>well enough who he was<a id='GBS.PA334.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.351.1.0.box.290.290.1297.1348.q.60'>
having conversed so long with him, and having, long before, so amply confessed him. And he <span style='font-style:italic;'>knew </span>also that he ought not, for anything in the world, to have denied him. That made him so confident before that he <span style='font-style:italic;'>would </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span>do it, because he was abundantly satisfied that he <span style='font-style:italic;'>should </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span>do it. Evident it is, then, that Peter wanted no <span style='font-style:italic;'>knowledge, </span>either of the Master&#39;s person, or of his own duty; and so no plea left him of <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorance, </span>either <span style='font-style:italic;'>faeti </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>juris. </span>Nor was the fault so much in his <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span>as to make it a sin properly of <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumption. </span>For albeit <span style='font-style:italic;'>de </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>faeto </span>he did deny him when he was put to it, and that with fearful oaths and imprecutions, yet was it not done with any prepensed apostacy, or out of design, yea, he came rather with a <span style='font-style:italic;'>contrary </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>resolution, </span>and he still honoured his Master <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart, </span>even then when he denied him with his tongue ; and as soon as ever the watchword was given him by the second cock, to prefer to his consideration what he had done, it grieved him sore that he had so done, and he wept bitterly for it. We find no circumstance, in the whole relation, that argueth any deep obstinacy in his <span style='font-style:italic;'>will. </span>But in his <span style='font-style:italic;'>affeetions, </span>then! Alas! there was the fail! A sudden qualm of fear surprising his soul when he saw his Master so despitefully used before his face (which made him apprehensive of what hard usage himself might fall under if he should there and then have owned him) took from him for that time the benefit and use of his reason, and so drew all his thoughts to this one point&#8212;how to decline the present danger&#8212; that he had never a thought at so much liberty as to consult his judgment, whether it were a sin or no. And this, proceeding from such a sudden distemper of passion, Peter&#39;s denial was a sin properly of <span style='font-style:italic;'>infirmity. </span>But David&#39;s sin, in contriving the death of Uriah, was of a yet higher pitch, and of a deeper dye than either of these. He was no such stranger in the law of God as not to know that the wilful murder of an innocent party, such as he also knew Uriah to be, was a most loud crying sin; and therefore nothing surer than that it was not merely a sin of <span style='font-style:italic;'>ignorance. </span>Neither yet was it a sin properly of <span style='font-style:italic;'>infirmity, </span>and so capable of that extenuating circumstance of being done in the heat of anger, as liis uncleanness with Bathsheba was in the heat of lust, although that extenuation will not be allowed to pass there, unless <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tanto </span>only, and as it standeth in comparison with this fouler crime. But having time and leisure enough to bethink himself what he was about, he doth it in <span style='font-style:italic;'>cool </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blood, </span>and with much advised <span style='font-style:italic;'>deliberation, </span>plotting and contriving this way and that way to perfect his design. He was <span style='font-style:italic;'>resolved, </span>whatsoever should become of it, to have it done ; in regard of which <span style='font-style:italic;'>settled </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>resolution </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will, </span>this sin of David was therefore a high <span style='font-style:italic;'>presumptuous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sin.</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Robert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sanderson </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>(Bishop </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lincoln), </span>1587&#8212;1662-3.</span></p>

In times of conflict loving subjects redouble their pleas, and surely in the sorrows of our Lord his church could not but be in earnest. All the Saviour&#39;s days were days of trouble, and he also made them days of prayer; the church joins her intercession with her Lord&#39;s, and pleads that he may be heard in his cries and tears. The agony in the garden was especially a gloomy hour, but he was heard in that he feared. He knew that his Father heard him always, yet in that troublous hour no reply came until thrice he had fallen on his face in the garden; then sufficient strength was given in answer to prayer, and he rose a victor from the conflict. On the cross also his prayer was not unheard, for in the twenty-second Psalm he tells us, &quot;thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.&#39;&#39; The church in this verse implies that her Lord would be himself much given to prayer; in this he is our example, teaching us that if we are to receive any advantage from the prayers of others, we must first pray for ourselves. What a mercy that we <span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span>pray in the day of trouble, and what a still more blessed privilege that no trouble can prevent the Lord from hearing us! Troubles roar like thunder, but the believer&#39;s voice will be heard above the storm.

There may be much in a royal name, or a learned name, or a venerable name, but it will be a theme for heavenly scholarship to discover all that is contained in the divine name. The glorious ]&gt;ower of God defended and preserved the Lord Jesus through the battle of his life and death, and exalted him above all his enemies. His warfare is now accomplished in his own proper person, but in his mystical body, the church, he is still beset with dangers, and only the eternal arm of our God in covenant cau defend the soldiers of the cross, and set them on high out of the reach of their foes. The day of trouble is not over, the pleading Saviour is not silent, and the name of the God of Israel is still the defence of the faithful. The name, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jacob,&#39;&#39; </span>is suggestive; Jacob had his day of trouble, he wrestled, was heard, was defended, and in due time was set on high, and his God is our God still, the same God to all his wrestling Jacobs. The whole verse is a very fitting benediction to be pronounced by a gracious heart over a child, a friend, or a minister, in prospect of trial ; it includes both temporal and spiritual protection, and directs the mind to the great Source of all good. How delightful to believe that our heavenly Father has pronounced it upon our favoured heads!</p>

There is no help like that which is of God&#39;s sending, and no deliverance like that which comes out of his sanctuary. The sanctuary to us is the person of our blessed Lord, who was typified by the temple, and is the true sanctuary which God has pitched, and not man: let us fly to the cross for shelter in all times of need and help will be sent to us. Men of the world despise sanctuary help, but our hearts have learned to prize it beyond all material aid. They seek help out of the armoury, or the treasury, or the buttery, but we turn to the sanctuary. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strengthen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Zion.&quot; </span>Out of the assemblies of the pleading saints who had for ages prayed for their Lord, help might well result to the despised sufferer, for praying breath is never spent in vain. To the Lord&#39;s mystical body the richest comes in answer to the pleadings of his saints assembled for holy worship as his Zion. Certain advertisers recommend a strengthening plaster, but nothing can give such strength to the loins of a saint as waiting upon God in the assemblies of his people. This verse is a benediction befitting a Sabbath morning, and may be the salutation either of a pastor to his people, or of a church to its minister. God in the sanctuary of his dear Son&#39;s person, and in the city of his chosen church is the proper object of his people&#39;s prayers, and under such a character may they confidently look to him for his promised aid.</p>

Still does his burnt sacrifice perfume the courts of heaven, and through him the offerings of his people are received as <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span>sacrifices and oblations. We ought in our spiritual conflicts to have an eye to the sacrifice of Jesus, and never venture to war until first the Lord has given us a token for good at the altar of the cross, where faith beholds her bleeding Lord. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Selah.&quot; </span>It is well to pause at the cross before we march onward to battle, and with the psalmist cry &quot; Selah.&quot; We are too much in a hurry to make good haste. A little pausing might greatly help our speed. Stay, good man, there is a haste which hinders; rest awhile, meditate on the burnt sacrifice, and put thy heart right for the stern work which lieth before thee.</p>

We may have our own will, when our will is God&#39;s will. This was always the case with our Lord, and yet he said, &quot; not as I will, but as thou wilt.&quot; What need for submission in our case; if it was necessary to him, how much more for us!</p>

We should fixedly resolve that come what may, we will rejoice in the saving arm of the Lord Jesus. The people in this psalm, before their king went to battle, felt sure of victory, and therefore began to rejoice beforehand; how much more ought we to do this who have seen the victory completely won!

The most dreaded war-engine or David&#39;s day was the warchariot, armed with scythes, which mowed down men like grass: this was the boast and glory of the neighbouring nations; but the saints considered the name of Jehovah to be a far better defence. As the Israelites might not keep horses, it was natural for them to regard the enemy&#39;s cavalry with more than usual dread. It is, therefore, all the greater evidence of faith that the bold songster can here disdain even the horse of Egypt in comparison with the Lord of hosts. Alas, how many in our day who profess to be the Lord&#39;s are as abjectly dependent upon their fellow-men or upon an arm of flesh in some shape &#39;or other, as if they had never known the name of Jehovah at all. Jesus, be thou alone our rock and refuge, and never may we mar the simplicity of our faith. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>We </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>remember </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span>GW.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;</span>Our God&quot; in covenant, who has chosen us and whom we have chosen ; this God is our Cod. The name of our God is <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Jehovah, </span>and this should never be forgotten; the self-existent, independent, immutable, ever-present, all-filling I AM. Let us adore that matchless name, and never dishonour it by distrust or creature confidence.

The enemies of God are uppermost at first, but they ere long are brought down by force, or else fall of their own accord. Their foundation is rotten, and therefoie when the time comes it gives way under them ; their chariots are burned in the fire, and their horses die of pestilence, and where is their boasted strength? As for those who rest on Jehovah, they are often cast down at the first onset, but an Almighty arm uplifts them, and they joyfully stand upright. The victory of Jesus is the inheritance of his people. The world, death, Satan, and sin, shall all be trampled beneath the feet of the champions of faith; while those who rely upon an arm of flesh shall be ashamed and confounded for ever.</p>

That Jesus might himself be delivered, and might then, as our King, hear us, is the two-fold desire of the Psalm. The first request is granted, and the second is sure to all the seed ; and therefore we may close the Psalm with the hearty shout, &quot;God save the King.&#39;&#39; &quot;God save King Jesus, and may he soon come to reign.&quot;</p>

There is frequently an adaptation to the circumstances of public worship. Thus, when the Jewish church wished to celebrate the great act of Messiah the High Priest making a sacrifice for the people on the day of atonement, as represented in the twenty-second Psalm, a subject so solemn, grand, and affecting, was not commenced suddenly and unpreparedly, but first a suitable occasion was sought, proper characters were introduced, and a scene in some degree appropriate to the great event was fitted for its reception. The priests and Levites endeavour to excite in the minds of the worshippers an exalted tone of reverential faith. The majesty and power of God, all the attributes which elevate the thoughts, are called in to fill the souls of the worshippers with the most intense emotion ; and when the feelings are strung to the highest pitch, an awful, astounding impression succeeds, when the words are slowly chanted, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; We are to suppose, then, that the series of Psalms, from the twentieth to the twenty-fourth inclusive, was used as a service or office in the public worship of the Jewish church.*&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Ii. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>II. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ryland, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M.A., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psalms </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Restored </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Messiah,&quot; </span>1853.</p>

If they did thus pray for him, being desired thereunto, and it, was their bound duty so to do, and they knew it to be so, and therefore did make conscience of it, and it had been a great fault for them to have failed in it; then by consequence it followeth of necessity, that whensoever any of our brethren or sisters in Christ, shall desire this duty at our hands, we must be careful to perform it; and it were a fault not to be excused in us, both against God and them, to fail in it. Therefore we must not think that when godly men and women at their parting or otherwise, desire our prayers, and say, &quot;I pray you pray for me,&quot; or, &quot;remember me in your prayers,&quot; that these are words of course (though I do not deny, but that many do so use them, and so doing they take the name of God in&#39; vain) ; but we should be persuaded, that out of the abundance of their feeling of their own wants they speak unto us, and so be willing by our prayers to help to supply them. And especially we should do it when they shall make known their estate unto us, as here David did to the people, giving them to understand that he should or might be in great danger of his enemies, and so it was &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>time </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trouble&quot; </span>unto him, as he called it. . . . Most of all, this duty of prayer ought to he carefully performed when we have promised it unto any upon such notice of their estate. For as all promises ought to be kept, yea, though it be to our own hindrance, so those most of all that so nearly concern them. And as if when any should desire us to speak to some great man for them, and we promise to do it, and they trust to it, hoping that we will be as good as our words; it were a great deceit in us to fail them, and so to frustrate their expectation ; so when any have desired us to speak to God for them, and upon our promise they would comfort themselves over it, if we should by negligence deceive them, it were a great fault in us, and that which the Lord would require at our hands, though they should never know of it. Therefore, as we ought daily to pray one for another unasked, as our Saviour Christ hath taught us, &quot; O our Father which art in heaven,&quot; etc., so more especially and by name should we do it for them that have desired it of us. And so parents especially should not forget their children in their prayers, which daily ask their blessing, and hope to be blessed of God by their prayers. Secondarily, if we should neglect to pray for them that have desired it at our hands, how could we have any hope that others whom we have desired to pray<a id='GBS.PA345.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.362.1.0.box.208.331.1297.355.q.60'>
for us should perform that duty unto us? Nay, might not we justly fear that they would altogether neglect it, seeing we do neglect them? and should it not be just with God so to punish us? according to the saying of our Saviour Christ, &quot;With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.&quot; Matt. vii. 2. And I remember that this was the saying of a reverend father in the church, who is now fallen asleep in the Lord, when any desired him to pray for them (as many did, and more than any that 1 have known), he would say unto them, &quot; I pray you. pray for me, and pray that I may remember you, and then I hope I shall not forget you.&quot; Therefore if we would have others pray for us, let us pray for them.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Nicholas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bownd. </span></span></p>

They might possibly be used for other purposes also. Occasions of joy, splendid processions, and especially a royal habitation, might severally be distinguished in this way. The words of the psalmist may perhaps be wholly figurative: but if they should be literally understood, the allusion of erecting a banner in the name of the Lord, acknowledging his&#39;glory, and imploring his favour, might be justified from an existing practice. Certain it is that we find this custom prevalent on this very principle in other places, into which it might originally have been introduced from Judea. Thus Mr. Turner <span style='font-style:italic;'>(Embassy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thibet, </span>p. 81), says, &quot;I was told that it was a custom with the Soobah to ascend the hill every month, when he sets up a white flag, and performs some religious ceremonies, to conciliate the favour of a dewta, or invisible being, the genius of the place, who is said to hover about the summit, dispensing at his will, good and evil to every thing around him.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Samuel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Burder&#39;s </span>&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Oriental </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Customs,&#39;&#39; </span>1812.</p>

Hence, on the pinnacles of their sacred cars, on the domes or gateways of their temples, and on the roof of a new house, may be seen the banner of the caste or sect, floating in the air.
