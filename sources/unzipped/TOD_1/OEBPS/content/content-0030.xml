Now in Psalm viii., you find there Adam&#39;s world, the type of a world to come; he was the first Adam, and had a world, so the second Adam hath a world also appointed for him ; there is his oxen and his sheep, and the fowls of the air, whereby are meant other things, devils perhaps, and wicked men, the prince of the air; as by the heavens there, the angels, or the apostles rather&#8212;&quot; the heavens declare the glory of God;&quot; that is applied to the apostles, that were preachers of the gospel.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.2.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.110.1.2.box.185.654.1294.177.q.60'>To make this plain to you, that that Psalm where the phrase is used, &quot;All things under his feet,&quot; and quoted by the apostle in Eph. i. 22&#8212;therefore it is proper&#8212;was not meant of man in innocency, but of the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ; and therefore, answerably, that the world there is not this world, but a world on purpose made for this Messiah, as the other was for Adam.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.3.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.110.1.3.box.186.831.1293.283.q.50'>First, it was not meant of man in innocency properly and principally. Why? Because in the first verse he saith, &quot;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength.&quot; There &#39;were no babes in the time of Adam&#39;s innocency, he fell before there were any. Secondly, he addeth, &quot;That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger ;&quot; the devil that is, for he showed himself the enemy there, to be a manslayer from the beginning. God would use man to still him; alas! he overcame Adam presently. It must be meant of another therefore, one that is able to still this enemy and avenger.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.4.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.110.1.4.box.186.1115.1292.140.q.60'>Then he saith, &quot;How excellent is thy name in all the earth ! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.&quot; Adam had but paradise, he never propagated God&#39;s name over all the earth ; he did not continue so long before he fell as to beget sons; much less did he found it in the heavens.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.5.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.110.1.5.box.186.1256.1293.133.q.50'>Again, verse 4, &quot;What is man, and the son of man?&quot; Adam, though he was man, yet he was not the son of man; he is called indeed, &quot;the son of God&quot; (Luke iii. 3S), but he was not <span style='font-style:italic;'>filius </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hominis. </span>I remember Ribera urgeth that.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.6.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.110.1.6.box.185.1397.1295.282.q.60'>But take an argument the apostle himself useth to prove it. This man, saith he, must have all subject to him; all but God, saith he; he must have the angels subject to him, for he hath put all principalities and powers under his feet, saith he. This could not be Adam, it could not be the man that had this world in a state of innocency ; much less had Adam all under his feet. No, my brethren, it was too great a vassalage for Adam to have the creatures thus bow to him. But they are thus to Jesus Christ, angels and all; they are all under his feet, he is far above them.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA93.w.1.7.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.110.1.7.box.185.1680.1298.677.q.50'>Secondly, it is not meant of man fallen, that is as plain; the&#39; apostle himself saith so. &quot;We sec not,&quot; saith he, &quot; all things subject unto him.&quot; Some think that it is meant as an objection that the apostle answereth ; but it is indeed to prove that man fallen cannot be meant in Psalm viii. Why? Because, saith he, we do not see anything, all things at least, subject unto him; you have not any one man, or the whole race of man, to whom all things have been subject; the creatures arc sometimes injurious to him. We do not see him, saith he ; that is, the nature of man in general considered. Take all the monarchs in the world, they never conquered the whole world; there was never any one man that was a sinner that had all subject to him. &quot;But we see,&#39;&#39; saith he&#8212;mark the opposition&#8212;&quot;but we sec Jesus,&quot; that Man, &quot; crowned with glory and honour;&#39;&#39; therefore, it is this Man, and no man else; the opposition implieth it.&quot; .... So now it rcmaineth, then, that it is only Christ, God-man, that is meant in Psalm viii. And indeed, and in truth, Christ himself interpreteth&#39;the Psalm ol himself; you have two witnesses to confirm it, Christ himself and the apostle. Matt. xxi. 16. When they cried hosanna to Christ, or &quot; save now,&quot; and made him the Saviour of the world, the Pharisees were angry, our Saviour confuteth them by this very Psalm: &quot;Have ye not read,&quot; saith he, &quot;out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?&quot; He quoteth this very Psalm<a id='GBS.PA94.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.111.1.0.box.299.274.1311.102.q.50'>

The apostles, who to outward appearance were despicable, in a manner children and sucklings in comparison of the great ones of the world; poor despised creatures, yet principal instruments of God&#39;s service and glory. Therefore &#39;tis notable, that when Christ gloritieth his Father for the wise and free dispensation of his saving grace (Matt. xi. 25), he saith, &quot; I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes,&quot; so called from the meanness of their condition. . . . And you shall see it was spoken when the disciples were sent abroad, and had power given them over unclean spirits. &quot;In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.&quot; This he acknowledged to be an act of infinite condescension in God. 5.

Night was made for man to rest in. But when I cannot sleep, may I, with the psalmist, entertain my waking with good thoughts.

These conditions rather tend to confuse the mind; and in this view of countless numbers and unlimited space there lies, moreover, much that belongs rather to a temporary and human than to an eternally abiding consideration. Still less do I regard them absolutely with reference to the life after this. But the mere thought they are so far beyond and above everything terrestrial&#8212;the feeling, that before them everything earthly so utterly vanishes to nothing&#8212;that the single man is so infinitely insignificant in the comparison with these worlds strewn over all space&#8212;that his destinies, his enjoyments, and sacrifices, to which he attaches such a minute importance&#8212;how all these fade like nothing before such immense objects; then, that the constellations bind together all the races of man, and all the eras of the earth, that they have beheld all that has passed since the beginning of time, and will see all that passes until its end; in thoughts like these I can always lose myself with a silent delight in the view of the starry firmament. It is, in very truth, a spectacle of the highest solemnity, when, in the stillness of night, in a heaven quite clear, the stars, like a choir of worlds, arise and descend, while existence, as it were, falls asunder into two separate parts; the one, belonging to earth, grows dumb in the utter silence of night, and thereupon the other mounts upward in all its elevation, splendour, and majesty.

But even there, the vast dominions of our great Creator would not terminate ; we should then find, to our astonishment, that we had only arrived at the borders of the works of God. It is but little that we can know of his works, but that little should teach us to be humble, and to admire the divine power and goodness. How great must that Being be who produced these immense globes out of nothing, who regulates their courses, and whose mighty hand directs and supports them all!

They are but atoms dancing in the air, which arc discovered to us by the sunbeams. What then am I, when reckoned among the infinite number of God&#39;s creatures? I am lost in mine own nothingness! But little as I appear in this respect, I find myself great in others. There is great beauty in this starry firmament which God has chosen for his throne! How admirable are those celestial bodies! I am dazzled with their splendour, and enchanted with their beauty! But notwithstanding this, however beautiful, and however richly adorned, yet this sky is void of intelligence. It is a stranger to its own beauty, while I, who am mere clay, moulded by a divine hand, am endowed with sense and reason. I can contemplate the beauty of these shining worlds; nay, more, I am already, to a certain degree, acquainted with their sublime Author; and by faith I see some small rays of his divine glory.

It has the authority of the sacred writers upon its side, and even our Saviour himself gives it the weight and the solemnity of his example. &quot;Behold the lilies of the field ; they toil not, neither do they spin, yet your heavenly Father careth for them.&quot; He expatiates on the beauty of a single flower, and draws from it the delightful argument of confidence in God. He gives us to see that taste may be combined with piety, and that the same heart may be occupied with all that is serious in the contemplations of religion, and be at the same time alive to the charms and the loveliness of nature. The psalmist takes a still loftier flight. He leaves the world, and lifts his imagination to that mighty expanse which spreads above it and ar&#8226;ound it. He wings his way through space, and wanders in thought over its immeasurable regions. Instead of a dark and unpeopled solitude, he sees it crowded with splendour, and filled with the energy of the divine presence. Creation rises in its immensity before him, and the world, with all which it inherits, shrinks into littleness at a contemplation so vast and so overpowering. He wonders that he is not overlooked amid the grandeur and the variety which are on every side of him; and, passing upward from the majesty of nature to the majesty of nature&#39;s Architect, he exclaims, &quot;What is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou shouldest deign to visit him?&quot; It is not for us to say whether inspiration revealed to the psalmist the wonders of the modern astronomy. But, even though the mind bo a perfect stranger to the science of these enlightened times, the heavens present a great and an elevating spectacle, an immense concave reposing upon the circular boundary of the world, and the innumerable lights which are Euspended from on high, moving with solemn regularity along its surface. It seems to have been at night that the piety of the psalmist was awakened by this contemplation; when the moon and the stars were visible, and not when the sun had risen in his strength and thrown a splendour around him, which bore down and eclipsed all the lesser glories of the firmament.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Chalmers, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>D.D., </span>1817. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Verse </span>3.&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heavens </span>&quot;:&#8212;</p>

his heart to me? Shall such a loathsome creature as I find favour in his eyes? In Ezek. xvi. 1&#8212;5, we have a relation of the wonderful condescension of God to man, who is there resembled to a wretched infant cast out in the day of its birth, in its blood and filthiness, no eye pitying it; such loathsome creatures are we before God ; and yet when he passed by, and saw us polluted in cur blood, he said unto us, &quot;Live.&quot; It is doubled because of the strength of its nature ; it was &quot; the time of love&quot; (verse 8). This was love indeed, that God should take a filthy, wretched thing, and spread his skirts over it, and cover its nakedness and swear unto it, and enter into a covenant with it, and make it his; that is, that he should espouse this loathsome thing to himself, that he would be a husband to it; this is love unfathomable, love inconceivable, self-principle love; this is the love of God to man, for God is love. Oh, the depth of the riches of the bounty and goodness of God! How is his love wonderful, and his grace past finding out! How do you find and feel your hearts affected upon the report of these things? Do you not see matter of admiration and cause of wonder? Are you not as it were launched forth into an ocean of goodness, where you can see no shore, nor feel no bottom? Ye may make a judgment of yourselves by the motions and affections that ye feel in yourselves at the mention of this. For thus Christ judged of the faith of the centurion that said unto him, &quot;Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof. When Jesus heard this, he marvelled, and said to tinm that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.&quot; Matthew viii. 8&#8212;10. If, then, you feel not your souls mightily affected&#39;with this condescension of God, say thus unto your souls, What aileth thee, O my soul, that thou art no more affected with the goodness of Gud? Art thou dead, that thou canst not feel? Or art thou blind, that thou canst not see thyself compassed about with astonishing goodness? Behold the King of glory descending from the habitation of his majesty, and coming to visit thee!

And it is a common speech with us when a house hath the plague, which is one of the highest strokes of temporal affliction, we use to say, &quot;Such a house is visited.&quot; Observe then, afflictions are visitations. . . . Secondly, to visit, in a good sense, signifies to show mercy, and to refresh, to deliver and to bless; &quot;Naomi heard how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.&quot; Ruth i. 6. &quot;The Lord visited Sarah,&quot; etc. Gen. xxi. 1, 2. That greatest mercy and deliverance that ever the children of men had, is thus expressed, &quot;The Lord hath visited and redeemed his people.&quot; Luke i. 68. Mercies are visitations; when God comes in kindness and love to do us good, he visiteth us. And these mercies are called visitations in two respects: 1. Because <span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>comes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>near </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us </span>when he doth us good; mercy is a drawing near to a soul, a drawing near to a place. As when God sends a judgment, or afflicts, he is said to depart and go away from that place ; so when be doth us good, he comes near, and as it were applies himself in favour to our persons and habitations. 2. They are called a visitation because of <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>freeness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them. </span>A visit is one of the freest things in the world ; there is no obligation but that of love to make a visit; because such a man is my friend and 1 love him, therefore I visit him. Hence, that greatest act of free grace in redeeming the world is called a visitation, because it was as freely done as ever any friend made a visit to see his friend, and with infinite more freedom. There was no obligation on man&#39;s side at all, many unkindnesses and neglects there were; God in love came lo redeem man. Thirdly, to visit imports an act of care and inspection, of tutorage and direction. The pastor&#39;s office over the flock is expressed by this act (Zech. x. 3; Acts xv. 36) ; and the care we ought to have of the fatherless and widows is expressed by visiting them. &quot;Pure religion.&quot; saith the apostle James, &quot;is this, To visit the fatherless a&#39;nd widows in their affliction&quot; (chap. i. 27) ; and in Matt. xxv. 34, Christ pronounceth the blessing on them who, when he was in prison, visited him, which was not a bare seeing, or asking &#39; how do you,&#39; but it was care of Christ in his imprisonment, and helpfulness and provision for him in his afflicted members. That sense also agrees well with this place, Job vii. 17, 18, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>What </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shouldst </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>visit </span>Aim?&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl. </span></p>

At*all events, we can be sure that nothing higher could be affirmed of the angels, than that they were made in the image of God. If, then, they had originally superiority over man, it must have been in the degree of resemblance. The angel was made immortal, intellectual, holy, powerful, glorious, and in these properties lay their likeness to the Creator. But were not these properties given also to man? Was not man made immortal, intellectual, holy, powerful, glorious? And if the angel excelled the man, it was not, we may believe, in the possession of properties which had no counterpart in the man; both bore God&#39;s image, and both therefore had lineaments of the attributes which centre in Deity. Whether or not these lineaments were more strongly marked in the angel than in the man, it were presumptuous to attempt to decide; but it is sufficient for our present purpose that the same properties must have been common to both, since both were modelled after the same divine image; and whatever originally the relative positions of the angel and the man, we cannot question that since the fall man has been fearfully inferior to the angels. The effect of transgression has been to debase all his powers, and so bring him down from his high rank in the scale of creation ; but, however degraded, and sunken, he still retains the capacities of his original formation, and since these capacities could have differed in nothing but degree from the capacities of the angel, it must be clear that they may be so purged and enlarged as to produce,</p>

If I search through the records of science, I may indeed find that, for the furtherance of magnificent purposes, God hath made man &quot;a little lower than the angels ;&quot; and I cannot close my eyes to the melancholy fact, that as a consequence upon apostacy there has been a weakening and a rifling of those splendid endowments which Adam might have transmitted unimpaired to his children. And yet the Bible teems with notices, that so far from being by nature higher than men, angels even now possess not an importance which belongs to our race. It is a mysterious thing, and one to which we scarcely dare allude, that there has arisen a Redeemer of fallen men, but not of fallen angels. We would build no theory on so awful and inscrutable a truth; but is it too much to say, that the interference on the behalf of man and the non-interference on the behalf of angels^ gives ground for the persuasion, that men occupy at least not a lower place than angels in the love and the solicitude of their Maker? Besides, are not angels represented as &quot;ministering spirits,<a id='GBS.PA103.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.120.1.0.box.205.323.1301.782.q.60'>
sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation?&#39;&#39; Arfd what is the idea conveyed by such a representation, if it be not that believers, being attended and waited on by angels, are as children of God marching forwards to a splendid throne, and so elevated amongst creatures, that those who have the wind in their wings, and are brilliant as a flame of fire, delight to do them honour? And, moreover, does not the repentance of a single sinner minister gladness to a whole throng of angels? And who shall say that this sending of a new wave of rapture throughout the hierarchy of heaven does not betoken such immense sympathy wilh men as goes far towards proving him the occupant of an immense space in the scale of existence? We may add, also, that angels learn of men; inasmuch as Paul declares to the Ephesians, that &quot;now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places is made known by the church, the manifold wisdom of God.&quot; And when we further remember, that in one of those august visions with which the Evangelist John was favoured, he beheld the representatives of the church placed immediately before the eternal throne, whilst angels, standing at a greater distance, thronged the outer circle, we seem to have accumulated proof that men are not to be considered as naturally inferior to angels&#8212;that however they may have cast themselves down from eminence, and sullied the lustre and sapped the strength of their first estate, they are still capable of the very loftiest elevation, and require nothing but the being restored to their forfeited position, and the obtaining room for the development of their powers, in order to their shining forth as the illustrious ones of the</span></p>

This is a very important representation&#8212;one that should be most attentively considered; and from it may be drawn, we think, a strong and clear argument for the divinity of Christ.</p>

We do not forget to how extreme degradation a Mediator must consent to be reduced, and through what suffering and ignominy he could alone achieve our redemption; but neither do we forget the unmeasured exaltation which was to be the Mediator&#39;s reward, and which, if Scripture be true, was to make him far higher than the highest of principalities and powers; and we know not where would have been the amazing humility, where the unparalleled condescension, had any mere creature consented to take the office on the prospect of such a recompense. A being who knew that he should be immeasurably elevated if he did a certain thing, can hardly be commended for the greatness of his humility in doing that thing. The nobleman who should become a slave, knowing that in consequence he should be made a king, does not seem to us to afford any pattern of condescension. He must be the king already, incapable of obtaining any accession to his greatness, ere his entering the state of slavery can furnish an example of humility. And, in like manner, we can never perceive that any being but a divine Being can justly be said to have given a model of</p>

These belonged necessarily to his nature, and could no more be parted with, even for a time, than could that nature itself.
