Now, our conformity to Christ appears, that as the promises miide to him were performed upon his prayers to his Father, his promises made to his saints are given to them in the same way of prayer: &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Ask </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me,&quot; </span>faith God to his Son, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glve </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thee.&#39;&#39; </span>And the apostle tells us, &quot;Ye have not, because ye ask not.&quot; God hath promised support to Christ in all his conflicts. Isaiah xlii. 1. &quot;Behold my servant, whom I uphold;&quot; yet he prayed &quot; with strong cries and tears,&quot; when his feet stood within the shadow of death. A seed is promised to him, and victory over his enemies, jet for both these he prays. Christ towards us acts as a king, but towards his Father as a priest. All he speaks to God is by prayer and intercession. So the faints, the promise makes them kings over their lusts, conquerors over their enemies ; but it nmkes them priests towards God, by prayer humbly to sue out those great things given in the promise.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall, </span>1617&#8212;1679.</p>

Now if the &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>thee<sup>&quot;</sup> </span>and the <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;for&quot; </span>are left out, the verse will read thus, &quot;Ask of me, and I shall give the heathen, thine inheritance, and thy possession, the uttermost parts of the earth.&quot; And this reading is decidedly preferable to the other. It implies that by some previous arrangement on the part of God, he hsd already assigned an inheritance of the heathen, and the possession of the earth, to the person of whom he says, &quot;Thou art my Son.&quot; And when God says, &quot;I will pive,&quot; etc., he reveals to his Anointed, not so much in what the inheritance consisted, and what was the extent of possession destined for him, as the promise of his readiness to bestow it. The heathen were already &quot;the inheritance,&quot; and the ends of the earth &quot; the possession,&quot; which God had <span style='font-style:italic;'>purposed </span>to give to his Anointed. Now he says to him, &quot; Ask of me,&quot; and he <span style='font-style:italic;'>promises </span>to fulfil his purpose. This is the idea involved in the words of the text, and the importance of it will become more apparent, when we consider its application to the <span style='font-style:italic;'>slnritual </span>David, to the true Son of God, &quot;whom he hath appointed the heir of all things.&quot;</p>

It might be of different materials, as it was employed for different purposes. At an early period, a wooden rod came into use as one of the insignia of royalty, under the name of sceptre. By degrees the sceptre grew in importance, and was regarded as characteristic of an empire, or of the reign of some particular king. A golden sceptre denoted wealth and pomp. The right, or straight sceptre, of which we read in Psalm xlv. 6, is expressive of the justice and uprightness, the truth and equity, which shall distinguish Messiah&#39;s reign, after his kingdom on earth has been established. But when it is said in Rev. xix. 15, that he, &quot; whose name is called the Word of God,&quot; will smite the nations, and &quot;rule them with a rod of iron,&quot; if the rod signifies &quot;his sceptre,&quot; then the &quot;iron&quot; of which it is made must be designed to express the severity of the judgments which this omnipotent &quot; King of kings&quot; will inflict on all who resist his authority. But to me it nppears doubtful whether the &quot;rod of iron&quot; symbolises the royal sceptre of the Son of God at his second advent. It is mentioned in connection with &quot;a sharp sword,&quot; which leads me to prefer the opinion that it also ought to be regarded as a weapon of war; at all events, the &quot; rod of iron&quot; mentioned in the Psalm we are endeavouring to explain, is evidently not the emblem of sovereign power, although represented as in the hands of a king, but an instrument of correction and punishment.. In this sense</p>

Even an iron rod, if gently used, or used against a hard and firm substance, might cause little injury; but, in the case before us, it is supposed to be applied with great force, &quot;Thou shalt <span style='font-style:italic;'>dash </span>them;&quot; and it is applied to what will prove as brittle and frangible as &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>potter&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vessel </span>&quot;&#8212;&quot; Thou shalt dash them <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pieces.&quot; </span>.... Here, as in other respects, we must feel that the predictions and promises of this Psalm were but very partially fulfilled in the history of the literal David. Their real accomplishment, their awful completion, abides the day when the spiritual David shall come in glory and in majesty as Zion&#39;s King, with a rod of iron to dash in pieces the great antichristian confederacy of kings and peoples, and to take possession of his long-promised and dearly-purchased inheritance.

Secondly, a serving with fear and a rejoicing with trembling; these are peculiar to the righteous who do righteousness at all times, and always rightly attemper both; never being without judgments, on the one hand, by which they are terrified and brought to despair of themselves and of all their own works; nor without that righteousness, on the other, on which they rest, and in which they rejoice in the mercy of God. It is the work of the whole lives of these characters to accuse themselves in all things, and in all things to justify and praise God. And thus they fulfil that word of Proverbs, &quot;Blessed is the man that feareth ahvay&quot; (xxviii. 14) ; and also that of Philip, iv. 4, &quot;Rejoice in the Lord ahvay.&quot; Thus, between the upper and nether nrll-stone (Deut. xxiv. 6), they are broken in pieces and humbled, and the husks being thus bruised off, they come forth the all-pure wheat of Christ.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Martin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luther. </span></span></p>

This was the unkindest cut of all, when they declared that his God had forsaken him. Yet David knew in his own conscience that he had given them some ground for this exclamation, for he had committed sin against God in the very light of day. Then they flung his crime with Bathsheba into his face, and they said, &quot;Go up, thou bloody man; God hath forsaken thee and left thee.&quot; Shimei cursed him, and swore at him to his very face, for he was bold because of his backers, since multitudes of the men of Belial thought of David in like fashion. Doubtless, David felt this infernal suggestion to be staggering to his faith. If all the trials which come from heaven, all the temptations which ascend from hell, and all the crosses which arise from earth, could be mixed and pressed together, they would not make a trial so terrible as that which is contained in this verse. It is the most bitter of all afflictions to be lead to fear that there is no help for us in God. And yet remember our most blessed Saviour had to endure this in the deepest degree when he cried, &quot; My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; He knew full well what it was to walk in darkness and to see no light. This was the curse of the curse. This was the wormwood mingled with the gall. To be deserted of his Father was worse than to be the despised of men. Surely we should love him who suffered this bitterest of temptations and trials for our sake. It will be a delightful and instructive exercise for the loving heart to mark the Lord in his agonies as here pourtrayed, for there is here, and in very many other Psalms, far more of David&#39;s Lord than of David himself.</span></p>

it is unquestionable that they have been so placed from time immemorial; they occur in the Septuagint, which contains also in a few instances titles to Psalms that are without any in the Hebrew ; and they have been copied after the Septuagint by Jerome. So far as the present writer has been able to penetrate the obscurity that occasionally hangs over them, they are a direct and most valuable key to the general history or subject of the Psalms to which they are prefixed ; and, excepting where they have been evidently misuuderstood or misinterpreted, he has never met with a single instance in which the drift of the title and its respective Psalm do not exuetly coincide. Many of them were, doubtless, composed by Ezra at the time of editing his own collection, at which period some crities suppose the whole to have been written; but the rest appear rather to be coeval, or nearly so, with the respective Psalms themselves, and to have been written about the period of their production.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mason </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Good, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>M.D., </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>F.R.S., </span>1854.</span></p>

Much has been written on this word, and still its meaning does not appear to be wholly determined. It is rendered in the Targum or Chaldee paraphrase, TP<sup>1</sup>?*&#39;<sup>1</sup>?, <span style='font-style:italic;'>lealmin, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever, </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eternity. </span>In the Latin Vulgate, it is omitted, as if it were no part of the text. In the Septuagint it is rendered <span style='font-style:italic;'>AiuipaX/ia, </span>supposed to refer to some variation or modulation of the voice in singing. Schleusner, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Lex. </span>The word occurs seventythree times in the Psalms, and three times in the book of Habakkuk (iii. 3, 9, 13). It is never translated in our version, but in all these places the original word <span style='font-style:italic;'>Selah </span>is retained. It occurs only in poetry, and is supposed to have had fome reference to the singing or cantillation of the poetry, and to be probably a musical term. In general, also, it indicates a pause in the sense, as well as in the musical performance. Gesenius <span style='font-style:italic;'>(Lex.) </span>supposes that the most probable meaning of this musical term or note is <span style='font-style:italic;'>silence </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>pause, </span>and that its use was, in chanting the words of the Psalm, to direct the singer <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>silent, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pause </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>little, </span>while the instruments played an interlude or harmony. Perhaps this is all that can now be known of the meaning of the word, and this is enough to satisfy every reasonable enquiry. It is probable, if this was the use of the term, that it would commonly correspond with the sense of the passage, and be inserted where the sense made a pause suitable; and this will doubtless be found usually to be the fact. But any one acquainted at all with the character of musical notation, will perceive at once that we are not to suppose that this would be invariably or necessarily the fact, for the musical pauses by no means always correspond with pauses in the sense. This word, therefore, can furnish very little assistance in determining the meaning of the passages where it is found. Ewald supposes, differing from this view, that it rather indicates that in the places where it occurs the voice is to be raised, and that it is synonymous with <span style='font-style:italic;'>up, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>higher, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>loud, </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>distinct, </span>from So, <span style='font-style:italic;'>sal, </span>V?D, <span style='font-style:italic;'>salal, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ascend. </span>Those who are disposed to enquire further respecting its meaning, and the uses of musical pauses in general, may be referred to Ugolin, &quot; Thesau. Antiq. Sacr.,&quot; tom. xxii. &#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Albert </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Barnes, </span>1868.</p>

While most authors have agreed in considering this word as somehow relating to the <span style='font-style:italic;'>music, </span>their conjectures about its precise meaning have varied greatly. But at present these two opinions chiefly obtain. Some, including Herder, Do Wette, Ewald <span style='font-style:italic;'>(Poet. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bitchcr, </span>i. 179), and Delitzsch, derive it from ^Sp, or V?D, <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>raise, </span>and understand an <span style='font-style:italic;'>elevation </span>of the voice or music; others, after Gesenius, in <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thesaurus, </span>derive it from nSo, <span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>still </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>silent, </span>and understand a pause in the singing. So Rosenmiiller, Hengstenberg, and Tholuck. Probably <span style='font-style:italic;'>selah </span>was used to direct the singer to be silent, or to pause a little, while the instruments played an interlude (so Sept., <span style='font-style:italic;'>diu.tya&#39;k/id) </span>or symphony. In Psalm ix. 16, it occurs in the expression <span style='font-style:italic;'>higgavm </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>selah, </span>which Gesenius, with much probability, renders <span style='font-style:italic;'>instrumental </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>music, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pause</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>i.e., </span>let the instruments strike up a symphony, and let the singer pause.

Truly it must be a soft pillow, indeed that could make him forget his danger, who then had such a disloyal army at his back hunting of him; yea, so transcendent is the influence of this peace, that it can make the creature lie down as cheerfully to sleep in the grave, as on the softest bed. You will say that child is willing that calls to be put to bed; some of the saints have desired God to lay them at rest in their beds of dust, and that not in a pet and discontent with their present trouble, as Job did, but from a sweet sense of this peace in their bosoms. &quot;Now let thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,&quot; was the swan-like song of old Simeon. He speaks like a merchant that had got all his goods on ship-board, and now desires the master of the ship to hoist sail, and be gone homewards. Indeed, what should a Christian, that is but a foreigner here, desire to stay any longer for in the world, but to get his full lading in for heaven? And when hath he that, if not when he is assured of his peace with God? This peace of the gospel, and sense of the love of God in the soul, doth so admirably conduce to the enabling of a person in all difficulties, and temptations, and troubles, that ordinarily, before he calls his saints to any hard service, or hot work, he gives them a draught of this cordial wine next their hearts, to cheer them up and embolden them in the conflict.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gurnall. </span></p>

Let us here limit our thoughts to this one idea, &quot;despite appearances.&quot; &#39;What could look worse to human sight than this array of ten thousands of people? Ruin seemed to stare him in the face ; wherever he looked an enemy was to be seen. What was one against ten thousand? It often happens that God&#39;s people come into circumstances like this; they say, &quot;All these things are against me ;&quot; they seem scarce able to count their troubles; they cannot see a loophole through which to escape; things look very black indeed; it is great faith and trust which says under these circumstances, &quot; I will not be afraid.&quot;</p>

His friend Spalatin heard it said, by the enemies of the Reformation, that the safe conduct of a heretic ought not to be respected, and became alarmed for the reformer. &quot;At the moment when the latter was approaching the city, a messenger appeared before him with this advice from the chaplain, <sup>1</sup> Do not enter Worms!&#39; And this from his best friend, the elector&#39;s confidant, from Spalatin himself! . . . But Luther, undismayed, turned his eyes upon the messenger, and replied, &#39;Go and tell your master, that even should there be as many devils in Worms as tiles upon the housetops, still I would enter it.&#39; The messenger returned to Worms, with this astounding answer: &#39;I was then undaunted,&#39; said Luther, a few days before his death, &#39;I feared nothing.&#39;&quot;</p>

Weak believers are now ready to make excuses for us, and we are only too ready to make them for ourselves; instead of rising above the weakness of the flesh, we take refuge under it, and use it as an excuse. But let us think prayerfully for a little while, and we shall see that it should not be thus with us. To trust only when appearances are favourable, is to sail only with the wind and tide, to believe only when we can see. Oh ! let us follow the example of the psalmist, and seek that unreservedness of faith which will enable us to trust God, come what will, and to say as he said, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>1 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>afraid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ten </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thousands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>set </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>themselves </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>round </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>about.&quot;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Philip </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bennett </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Power&#39;s </span>&#39;<span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wills</span>&#39; <span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psalms, </span>1862.</p>
