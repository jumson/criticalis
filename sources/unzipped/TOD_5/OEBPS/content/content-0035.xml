As in a great house there is necessary use of vessels of dishonour, destined unto sordid and mean, but yet daily, services: so in the great house of God, wicked men are his utensils and household instruments, as footstools and staves, and vessels wherein there is no pleasure, though of them there may be good use.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Condensed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Reynolds. </span></p>

Yea, how strange is it, and how greatly doth it commend the power of this word, to see weakness hereby prevailing against strength, simplicity against policy; to see the lamb standing without fear before the lion, the gentle turtle before the devouring kite; women and children and weaklings before the great monarchs and potentates of the world, not fearing their threatening words, nor dreading their tormenting hands, but boldly uttering the word of their testimony (Rev. xii. 11), in despite of all their fury, and never yielding to shrink from it, by anything that could be devised against them.

The soldiers are gathered in the day of the muster, with high courage and willing devotion, ready to fling away their lives; but they are clad not in mail, hut in priestly robes; like those who wait before the altar rather than like those who plunge into the fight, like those who compassed Jericho with the ark for their standard and the trumpets for all their weapons.

A French traveller,s has observed of Judea, that in the morning the gtound is as much moistened by dew, as if it had rained. We are infoimed in the sacred history, that, when the Dayspring from on high visited the earth, many weie the followers of Christ; and that very soon after his ascension into heavin, &quot;multitudes both of men and women were added to the Lord.&quot; Justly then may those who hastened to the blessed Jesus, when the glorious light of his gospel fir,t dawned upon the world, or immediately on the commencement of his mediatorial kingdom, be compared in number to the drops of dew, which at the dawn of day fall to the earth.</p>

Because the salvation and redemption of mankind, wrought by the sacrifice of his priesthood, being a most noble work, and not inferior to the creation, it was not fit that any should have the honour of it, but the Son of God. 2. Neither was it agreeable that any should offer him, who was the only sacrifice that could expiate the sins of the whole world, but himself : therefore by offering himself he added infinite worth to the sacrifice, and great honour to the priesthood of the Gospel. For, as the gold sanctifieth not the altar, but the altar the gold; so it may be truly said without impeachment to the dignity of that calling, that Christ was rather an honour to the priesthood, than the priesthood an addition to him. For what got he by the priesthood which cost him his life? AVhat preferment could it be to him, to take upon him an office, whereby he was to abase himself below himself, and be put to an ignominious and accursed death? What were we vile miscreants, conceived and born in original sin, and soiled with the filth of numberless actual transgressions, that to purge and cleanse our polluted souls and defiled consciences, the second person in the Trinity should be made a Priest? It was wonderful humility in him to wash his disciples&#39; feet; but in his divine person to wash our unclean souls, is as far above human conceit, as it seemeth below divine majesty. There is, nothing so impure as a foul conscience; no matter so filthy, no corruption so rotten and unsavoury as is found in the sores of an cxulcerated mind: yet the Son of God vouchsafed to wash and bathe them in his own blood.

was appointed by God for the service and salvation of men : other priests spilt the blood of beasts to save men, but he shed his own blood to save us, more like beasts than men: other priests offered sacrifice for themselves, he offered himself for a sacrifice: other priests were fed by the sacrifices which the people brought, but he feeds us with the sacrifice of his own body and blood : lastly, others were appointed priests but for a time, he was ordained a priest <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Daniel </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Veatlcy. </span></span></p>
