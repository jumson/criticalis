The soul elevated and filled with a sense of divine glory cannot wait to fashion a preface, but springs at once into the middle of its theme. Israel emphatically came out of Egypt, out of the population among whom they had been scattered, from under the yoke of bondage, and from under the personal grasp of the king who had made the people into national slaves. Israel came out with a high hand and a stretched-out arm, dpfying all the power of the empire, and making the whole of Egypt to travail with sore anguish, as the chosen nation was as it were born out of its midst. <span style='font-style:italic;'><sup>ll</sup>The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>house </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jacob </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>strange </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>language.&quot; </span>They had gone down into Egypt as a single family&#8212;&quot; the house of Jacob &quot; ; and, though they had multiplied greatly, they were still so united, and were so fully regarded by God as a single unit, that they are rightly spoken of as the house of Jacob. They were as one man in their willingness to leave Goshen ; numerous as they were, not a single individual stayed behind. Unanimity is a pleasing token of the divine presence, and one of its sweetest fruits. One of their inconveniences in Egypt was the difference of languages, which was very great. The Israelites appear to have regarded the Egyptians as stammerers and babblers, since they could not understand them, and they very naturally consideied the Egyptians to be barbarians, as they would no doubt often beat them because they did not comprehend their orders. The language of foreign taskmasters is never musical in an exile&#39;s ear. flow sweet it is to a Christian who has been compelled to hear the filthy conversation<a id='GBS.PA253.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.274.1.0.box.128.296.1300.73.q.60'>

Before the formation of the two kingdoms David had said, &quot;Go number Israel and Judah,&quot; and this was common parlance, for Uriah the Hitlite said, &quot;The ark, and Israel and Judah abide in tents&quot; ; so that nothing can be inferred from the use of the two names. No division into two kingdoms can have been intended here, for the poet is speaking of the coming out of Egypt when the people were so united that he has just before called them &quot; the house of Jacob.&quot; It would be quite as fair to prove from the first verse that the Psalm was written when the people were in union as to prove from the second that its authorship dates from their separation. Judah was the tribe which led the way in the wilderness march, and it was foreseen in prophecy to be the royal tribe, hence its poetical mention in this place. The meaning of the passage is that the whole people at the coming out of Egypt were separated unto the Lord to be a peculiar people, a nation of priests whose motto should be, &quot; Holiness unto the Lord.&quot; Judah was the Lord&#39;s &quot;holy thing,&quot; set apart for his special use. The nation was peculiarly Jehovah&#39;s dominion, for it was governed by a theocracy in which God alone was King. It was his domain in a sense in which the rest of the world was outside his kingdom. These were the young days of Israel, the time of her espousels, when she went after the Lord into the wilderness, her. God leading the way with signs and miracles. The whole people were the shrine of Deity, and their camp was one great temple. What a change there must have been for the godly amongst them from the idolatries and blasphemies of the Egyptians to the holy worship and righteous rule of the great King in Jeshurun. They lived in a world of wonders, where God was seen in the wondrous bread they ate and in the water they drank, as well as in the solemn worship of his holy place. When the Lord is manifestly present in a church, and his gracious rule obediently owned, what a golden age has come, and what honourable privileges his people enjoy! May it be so among us.</p>

A bold figure! The Red Sea mirrored the hosts which had come down to its shore, and reflected the cloud which towered high over all, as the symbol of the presence of the Lord: never had such a scene been imaged upon the surface of the Red Sea, or any other sea, before. It could not endure the unusual and astounding sight, and fleeing to the right and to the left, opened a passage for the elect people. A like miracle happened at the end of the great march of Israel, for <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Jordan </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>driven </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>back.&quot; </span>This was a swiftlyflowing river, pouring itself down a steep decline, and it was not merely divided, but its current was driven back so that the rapid torrent, contrary to nature, flowed up-hill. This was God&#39;s work: the poet does not sing of the suspension of natural laws, or of a singular phenomenon not readily to be explained; but to him the presence of God with his people is everything, and in his lofty song he tells how the river was driven back because the Lord was there. In this case poetry is nothing but the literal fact, and the fiction lies on the side of the atheistic crities who will suggest any explanation of the miracle rather than admit that the Lord made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all his people. The division of the sea and the drying up of the river are placed together though</p>

Men fear the mountains, but the mountains tremble before the Lord. Sheep and lambs move lightly in the meadows; but the hills, which we are wont to call eternal, were as readily made to move as the most active creatures. Rams in their strength, and lambs in their play, are not more stirred than were the solid hills when Jehovah marched by. Nothing is immovable but God himself: the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but the covenant of his grace abideth fast for ever and ever. Even thus do mountains of sin and hills of trouble move when the Lord comes forth to lead his people to their eternal Canaan. Let us never fear, but rather let out faith say unto this mountain, &quot;Be thou removed hence and cast into the sea,&quot; and it shall be done.</p>

God has come nearer to us than ever he did to Sinai, or to Jordan, for he has assumed our nature, and yet the mass of mankind are neither driven back from their sins, nor moved in the paths of obedience.</p>

As I was describing the journey of Israel from Egypt, and added the Divine Presence amongst them, I perceived a beauty in this psalm, which was entirely new to me, and which I was going to lose; and that is, that the poet utterly conceals the presence of God in the beginning of it, and rather lets a possessive pronoun go without a substantive, than he will so much as mention anything of divinity there. &quot;Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion&quot; or kingdom. The reason now seems evident, and this conduct necessary; for, if God had appeared before, there could be no wonder why the mountains should leap and the sea retire; therefore, that this convulsion of nature may be brought in with due surprise, his name is not mentioned till afterwards; and then with a very agreeable turn of thought, God is introduced at once in all his majesty. This is what I have attempted to imitate in a translation without paraphrase, and to preserve what I could of the spirit of the sacred author.</p>

One is that Psalm cxiv. was always sung in immediate connection with cxiii., in which the name of God occurs no less than six times, so that the continuance of the train of thought made a fresh repetition of it here unnecessary. But this view, to be fully consistent with itself, must assume that the two Psalms are really one, with a merely arbitrary division, which does not, on the face of the matter, seem by any means probable, as the scope of thought in the two is perfectly distinct. The other, which is moie satisfactory, regards the omission of the Holy Name in this part of the Psalm as a practical artifice to heighten the effect of the answer to the sudden apostrophe in verses five and six.

By his appointment, the host, amounting probably to two millions-and-a-half of persons (about the same number as had crossed the Red Sea on foot), had removed to the banks of the river three days before, and now in marching array awaited the signal to cross the stream. At any time the passage of the river by such a multitude, with their women and children, their flocks and herds, and all their baggage, would have presented formidable difficulties; but now the channel was tilled with a deep and impetuous torrent, which overflowed its banks and spread widely on each side, probably extending nearly a mile in width ; while in the very sight of the scene were the Canaanitish hosts, who might be expected to pour out from their gates, and exterminate the invading multitude before they could reach the shore. Yet these difficulties were nothing to Almighty power, and only served to heighten the effect of the stupendous miracle about to be wrought.</p>

Thus it was manifest that Jehovah needed not protection from Israel, but was their guard and guide, since the unarmed priests feared not to separate themselves from the host, and to venture with the ark into the river in the face of their enemies. And thus the army, standing aloof, had a better opportunity of seeing the wondrous results, and of admiring the mighty power of God exerted on their behalf; for no sooner had the feet of the priests touched the brim of the overflowing river, than the swelling waters receded from them ; and not only the broad lower valley, but even the deep bed of the stream was presently emptied of water, and its pebbly bottom became dry. The waters which had been in the channel speedily ran off, and were lost in the Dead Sea; whilst those which would naturally have replaced them from above, were miraculously suspended, and accumulated in a glassy heap far above the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan. These places are supposed to have been at least forty miles above the Dead Sea, and may possibly have been much tnore; so that nearly the whole channel of the Lower Jordan, from a little below the Lake of Tiberias to the Dead Sea,</p>

It seems, therefore, to have been providentially designed to silence cavils respecting the former: and it was done at noon-day, in the face of the sun, and in the presence, we may be sure, of the neighbouring inhabitants, and struck terror into the kings of the Canaanites and Amorites westward of the river.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Philip </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Henry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gosse, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Sacred </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Streams,&quot; </span>1877.</p>

On the broken edge of the swollen stream, the band of priests stood with the ark on their shoulders. At the distance of nearly a mile in the rear was the mass of the army. Suddenly the full bed of the Jordan was dried before them. High up the river, &quot;far, far away,&quot; &quot; in Adam, the city which is beside Zarctan,&quot; &quot; as far as the parts of Kirjath-jearim&quot; (Josh. iii. 16), that is, at a distance of thirty miles from the place of the Israelite encampment, the waters there stood which &quot; descended &quot; &quot; from the heights above,&quot;&#8212;stood and rose up, as if gathered into a waterskin; as if in a barrier or heap, as if congealed ; and those that &quot; descended &quot; towards the sea of &quot; the desert,&quot; the Salt Sea, &quot;failed and were cut off.&quot; Thus the scene presented is of the descending stream&quot; (the words employed seem to have a special reference to that peculiar and most significant name of the &quot; Jordan&quot;), not parted asunder, as we generally fancy, but, as the Psalm expresses it, &quot; turned backwards&quot; ; the whole bed of the river left dry from north to south, through its long windings; the huge stones lying bare here and there, imbedded in the soft bottom; or the shingly pebbles drifted along the course of the channel.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Arthur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Penrhyn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Stanley, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>.&#39;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>History </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jewish </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Church,&quot; </span>1870.</p>

It is an isolated mass of granite, nearly twenty feet square and high, with its base concealed in the earth&#8212;we are left to conjecture to what depth. In the face of the rock are a number of horizontal fissures, at unequal distances from each other; some near the top, and others at a little distance from the surface of the ground. An American traveller* says: &quot;The colour and whole appearance of the rock are such that, if seen elsewhere, and disconnected from all traditions, no one would hesitate to believe that they had been produced by water flowing from these fissures. I think it would be extremely difficult to form these fissures or produce these appearances by art. It is not less difficult to believe that a natural fountain should flow at the height of a dozen feet out of the face of an isolated rock. Believing, as I do, that the water was brought out of a rock belonging to this mountain, 1 can see nothing incredible in the opinion that this is the identical rock, and that these fissures, and the other appearances, should be regarded as evidences of the fact.&quot;&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kitto. </span></p>
