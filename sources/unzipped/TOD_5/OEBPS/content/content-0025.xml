Compared with him there is none good, no, not one: but he is essentially, perpetually, superlatively, infinitely good. We aie the perpetual partakers of his goodness, and therefore ought above all his creatures to magnify his name. Our praise should be increased by the fact that the divine goodness is not a transient thing, but in the attribute of mercy abides for ever the same, &quot;/or <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>meicy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>The word <span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span>has been properly supplied by the translators, but yet it somewhat restricts the sense, which will be better seen if we read it, &quot;/or <span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.<sup>&quot;</sup> </span>That mercy had no beginning, and shall never know an end. Our sin required that goodness should display itself to us in the form of mercy, and it has done so, and will do so evermore; let us not be slack in praising the goodness which thus adapts itself to our fallen nature.</p>

A soul without sympathy is on the borders of hell : a solitary way is the way of despair.. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>found </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>e.ity </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dwell </span>How could</p>

Such is the condition of an awakened conscience before it knows the Lord Jesus ; it is full of unsatisfied cravings, painlul needs, aud heavy fears. It is utterly spent and without strength, anu there is nothing in the whole cieation which can minister to its refreshment.</p>

Supplications which are foieed out of us by Btern necessity are none the less acceptable with God; but, indeed, they have all the more prevalence, since they aie evidently sincere, aiid make a pjwerful appeal to the diviue pity. Some men will never pray till they are half-starved, and for their best interests it is far better for them to be empty and faint than to be full and stoutheaited. If hunger brings us to our knees it is more useful to us than feasting; if thirst dihes us to the fountain it is better than the deepest draughts cf worldly jojs; and if fainting kads to crying it is better than the strength of the mighty. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>delivered </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>distresses.&quot; </span>Deliverance follows prayer most surely. The ciy must have been very feeble, for they were faint, aud their faith was as weak as their cry ; but yet they were heard, and heard at once. A little delay would have been their death : but there was none, for the Lord was ready to sate them. The Lord delights to come in when no one else can be of the slightest avail. The case was hopeless till Jehovah interposed, and then all was changed immediately ; the people were shut up, straitened, and almost pressed to death, but enlargement came to them at once when they began to remember their God, and look to him in prayer. Those deserve to die of hunger who will not so much as ask for bread, and he who being lost in a desert will not beg the aid of a guide cannot be pitied even if he perish in the wilds and feed the vultures with his flesh.</p>

What a difference it made to them to leave their solitude for a city, their trackless path for well-frequented streets, and their faintness of heart for the refreshment of a home! Far greater are the changes which divine love works in the condition of sinners when God answers their prayers aud brings them to Jesus. Shall not the Lord be magnified for such special mercies?

In the life of each one of the redeemed there is a world of wonders, and therefore from each there should resound a world of praises. As to the marvels of grace which the Lord has wrought for his church as a whole there is no estimating them, they are as high above our thoughts as the heavens are high above the earth. When shall the day dawn when the favoured race of man shall be as devoted to the praise of God as they are distinguished by the favour of God?</span></p>

He who in a natural sense has been rescued from perishing in a howling wilderness ought to bless the Lord who brings him again to eat bread among men. The spiritual sense is, however, the more nch in instruction. The Lord sets us longing and then completely satisfies tis. That longing leads us into solitude, separation, thirst, faintness and selfdespair, and all these conduct us to prayer, faith, divine guidance, satisfying of the soul&#39;s thirst, and rest: the good hand of the Lord is to be seen in the whole process and in the divine result. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fdleth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hungry </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>goodness.&quot; </span>As for thirst he gives satisfaction, so for hunger he supplies filling. In both cases the need is more than met, theie is an abundance in the supply which is well worthy of notice: the Lord does nothing in a niggardly fashion; satisfying and filling are his peculiar modes of treating his guests; none who come under the Lord&#39;s providing ever complain of short commons. Nor docs he fill the hungry with common fare, but with <span style='font-style:italic;'>goodness </span>itself. It is not so much good, as . the essence of goodness which he bestows on needy suppliants. Shall man be thus royally supplied and return no praise for the largesses of love? It must not be so. We will even now give thanks with all the redeemed church, and pray for the time when the whole earth shall be filled with his glory.</p>

linger in places only fit to be tombs; unhealthy, suffocating, filthy sepulchres, where they have sickened and died of broken hearts. Meanwhile the dread of sudden death has been the most hideous part of the punishment; the prisoners have felt as if the chill shade of death himself froze them to the very marrow. The state of a soul under conviction of sin is forcibly symbolized by such a condition; persons in that state cannot see the promises which would yield them comfort, they sit still in the inactivity of despair, they fear the approach of judgment, and are thereby as much distressed as if they were at death&#39;s door. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;Being </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bound </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>affliction </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>iron.&quot; </span>Many prisoners have been thus doubly fettered in heart and hnnd ; or the text may mean that affliction becomes as an iron band to them, or that the iron chains caused them great affliction. None know these things but those who have felt them; we should prize our liberty more if we knew by actual experience what manacles and fetters mean. In a spiritual sense affliction frequently attends conviction of sin, and then the double grief causes a double bondage. In such cases the iron enters into the soul, the poor captives cannot stir because of their bonds, cannot rise to hope because of their grief, and have no power because of their despair. Misery is the companion of all those who are shut up and cannot come forth. O ye who are made free by Christ Jesus, remember those who are in bonds.</span></p>

As they have no liberty, so they have no rest. This soon subdues the stoutest heart, and makes the proud boaster sing another tune. Trouble and haid toil are enough to tame a lion. God has methods of abating the loftiness of rebellious looks; the cell and the mill make even giants tremble. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;They </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fell </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>none </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>help.&quot; </span>Stumbling on in the dark beneath their weary task, they at last fell prone upon the ground, but no one came to pity them or to lift them up. Their fall might be fatal for aught that any man cared about them ; their misery was unseen, or, if observed, no one could interfere between them and their tyrant masters. In such a wretched plight the rebellious Israelite became more lowly in mind, and thought more tenderly of his God and of his offences against him. When a soul finds all its efforts at self-salvation prove abortive, aud feels that it is now utterly without strength, then the Lord is at work hiding pride from man and preparing the afflicted one to receive his mercy. The spiritual case which is here figuratively described is desperate, and therefore affords the finer field for the divine interposition; some of us remember well how brightly mercy shone in our prison, aud what music the fetters made when they fell off from our hands. Nothing but the Lord&#39;s love could have delivered us; without it we must have utterly perished.</p>

In these two verses we see how the Lord at will turns the wheel of providence. Paying no respect to man&#39;s imaginary grandeur, he puts princes down and makes them wander in banishment as they had made their captives wander when they drove them from land to land : at the same time, having ever a tender regard for the poor and needy, the Lord delivers the distressed and sets them in a position of comfort and happiness. This is to be seen upon the roll of history again and again, and in spiritual experience we remark its counterpart: the selfsufficient are made to despise themselves and search in vain for help in the wilderness of their nature, while poor convicted souls arc added to the Lord&#39;s family and dwell in safety as the sheep of his fold.</p>

Oh! how adorable, then, and gracious is this attribute! how sweet is it and full of consolation to the guilty.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Romaine </span>(1714&#8212;1795), <span style='font-style:italic;'>iri </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Practical </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Comment </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hundred </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Seventh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psalm.&quot; </span></p>
