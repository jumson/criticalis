The true seed of the righteous are those who follow them in their virtues, even as believers are the seed of Abraham, because they imitate his faith ; and these are the real heroes of their era, the truly great men among the sons of Adam ; their lives are sublime, and their power upon their age is far greater than at first sight appears. If the promise must be regarded as alluding to natural seed, it must be understood as a general statement rather than a promise made to every individual, for the children of the godly are not all prosperous, nor all famous. Nevertheless, he who fears God, and leads a holy life, is, as a rule, doing the best he can for the future advancement of his house; no inheritance is equal to that of an unblemished name, no legacy can excel the benediction of a saint; and, taking matters for all in all, the children of the righteous man commence life with greater advantages than others, and are more likely to succeed in it, in the best and highest sense. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>generation </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upright </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span>Wesserf.&quot; The race of sincere, devout, righteous men, is kept up froth age to age, and ever abides under the blessing of God. The godly may be persecuted, but they shall not be forsaken ; the curses of men cannot depme them of the blessing of God. for the words of Balaam are true, &quot; He hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.&quot; Their children also are under the special care of heaven, and as a rule it shall be found that they inherit the divine blessing. Honesty and integrity are better corner-stones for an honourable house than mere cunning and avarice, or even talent and push. To fear God and to walk uprightly is a higher nobility than blood or birth can bestow.</p>

Many are kept poor through knavery and profligacy; but godliness hath the promise of the life that now is. If we understand the passage spiritually it is abundantly true. What wealth can equal that of the love of God? What riches can rival a contented heart? It matters nothing that the roof is thatched, and the floor is of cold stone : the heart which is cheered with the favour of heaven is &quot;rich to all the intents of bliss.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteousness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trer.&quot; </span>Often when gold comes in the gospel goes out; but it is not so with the blessed man.

the humility of his heart. His character stands the test of examination, overcomes the temptations of wealth, survives the assaults of slander, outlives the afflictions of time, and endures the trial of the last great day. The righteousness of a true saint endureth for ever, because it springs from the same root as the righteousness of God, and is, indeed, the reflection of it. So long as the Lord abideth righteous he will maintain by his grace the righteousness of his people. They shall hold on their way, and. wax stronger and stronger. There is also another righteousness which belongs to the Lord&#39;s chosen, which is sure to endure for ever, namely, the imputed righteousness of the Lord Jesus, which is called &quot;everlasting righteousness,&quot; belonging as it does to the Son of God himself, who is &quot; the Lord our righteousness.&quot;</span></p>

He will have his days of daikness, he may be sick and sorry, poor and pining, as well as others; his former riches may take to themselves wings and fly away, while even his righteousness may be cruelly suspected; thus the clouds may lower around him, but his gloom shall not last for ever, the Lord will bring him light in due season, for as surely as a good man&#39;s sun goes down it shall rise again. If the daikness be caused by depression of spirit, the Holy Ghost will comfort him; if by pecuniary loss or personal bereavement, the presence of Christ shall be his solace; and if by the cruelty and malignity of men, the sympathy of his Lord shall be his support. It is as ordinary for the righteous to be comforted as for the day to dawn. Wait for the light and it will surely come ; for even if our heavenly Father should in our last hours put us to bed in the dark, we shall find it morning when we awake. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gracious, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>full </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>compassion, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteovi.&quot; </span>This is spoken of God in the fourth verse of the hundred and eleventh Psalm, and now the same words are used of his servant : thus we are taught that when God makes a man upright, he makes him like himself. &quot;We are at best but humble copies of the great original; still we are copies, and because we are so we praise the Lord, who hath created us anew in Christ Jesus. The upright man is &quot; gracious,&#39;&#39; that is, full of kindness to all around him; he is not sour and churlish, but he is courteous to friends, kind to the needy, forgiving to the erring, and eainest for the good of all. He is also &quot; full of compassion&quot;&#39;; that is to say, he tenderly feels for others, pities them, nnd as far as be can assists them in their time of trouble. He does not need to be driven to benevolence, he is brimful of humanity; it is his joy to sympathize with the sorrowing. He is also said to be &quot;righteous&quot; : in all his transactions with his fellow men he obeys the dictates of right, and none can say that he goes beyond or defrauds his neighbour. His justice is, however, tempered with compassion, nnd seasoned with graciousness. Such men are to be found in our chuiche?, and they are by no means so rare as the censorious imagine ; but at the same time they are far scarcer than the breadth of profession might lead us to hope. Lord, make us all to possess these admirable qualities.</p>

be so discreet that no one may have the slightest reason to suspect him of being otherwise. When the righteous man lends he exercises prudence, not risking his all, for fear he should not be able to lend again, and not lending so very little that the loan is of no service. He drives his affairs, and does not allow them to drive him; his accounts are straight and clear, his plans are wisely laid, and his modes of operation carefully selected. He is prudent, thrifty, economical, sensible, judicious, discreet. Men call him a fool for his religion, but they do not find him so when they come to deal with him. &quot;The beginning of wisdom&quot; has made him wise, the guidance of heaven has taught him to guide his affairs, and with half an eye one can see that he is a man of sound sense. Such petsons greatly commend godliness. Alas, some professedly good men act as if they had taken leave of their senses; this is not religion, but stupidity. True religion is sanctified common sense. Attention to the things of heaven does not necessitate the neglect of the affairs of earth; on the contrary, he who has learned how to transact business with God ought to be best able to do business with men. The children of this world often are in their generation wiser than the children of light, but there is no reason why this proverb should continue to be true.</span></p>

are some who are strangely destitute of it. They are great at gathering, but very slow at dispersing; they enjoy the blessedness of receiving, but seldom taste the greater joy ot giving. &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive&quot; &#8212;perhaps they think that the blessing of receiving is enough for them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#8226;&#39;Hit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteousness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>His liberality has salted his righteousness, proved its reality, and secured its peipetuity. This is the second time that we have this remarkable sentence applied to the godly man, and it must be understood as resulting from the enduring mercy of the Lord. The character of a righteous man is not spasmodic, he is not generous by fits and starts, nor upright in a few points only; his life is the result of principle, his actions flow from settled, sure, and fixed convictions, and therefore his integrity is maintained when others fail. He is not turned about by companions, nor affected by the customs of society; he is resolute, determined, and immovable. <span style='font-style:italic;'>horn </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exalted </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>honour.&quot; </span>God shall honour him, the universe of holy beings shall honour him, and even the wicked shall feel an unconscious reverence of him. Let it be observed, in summing up the qualities of the Godfearing man, that he is described not merely as iighteous, but as one bearing the character to which Paul refers in the memorable verse, &quot;For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>yood </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>man </span>some would even dare to die.&quot; Kindness, benevolence, and generosity, are essential to the perfect character; to be strictly just is not enough, for God is love, and we must love our neighbour as ourselves : to give every one his due is not sufficient, we must act upon those same principles of grace which reign in the heart of God. The promises of establishment and prosperity are not to churlish Nabals, nor to niggard Labans, but to bountiful souls who have proved their fitness to be stewards of the Lord by the right way in which they use their substance.</span></p>

The child of wrath shall be obliged to witness the blessedness of the righteous, though the sight shall make him gnaw his own heart. He shall fiet and fume, lament and wax angry, but he shall not be able to prevent it, for God&#39;s blessing is sure and effectual, &quot;//e <span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gnash </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tveth.&#39;&#39; </span>Being veiy wrathful, and exceedingly envious, he would fain grind the iighteous between his teeth ; but as he cannot do that, he grinds his teeth against each other. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>melt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>away.&quot; </span>The heat of his passion shall melt him like wax, and the sun of God&#39;s providence shall dissolve him like snow, and at the last the fire of divine vengeance shall consume him as the fat of rams. How horrible must that life be which like the snail melts as it proceeds, leaving a slimy trail behind. Those who are grieved at goodness deserve to be worn away by such an abominable sorrow. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>desire </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wicked </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shall </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>perish.&quot; </span>He shall not achieve his purpose, he shall die a disappointed man. By wickedness he hoped to accomplish his purpose&#8212;that very wickedness shall be his defeat. While the righteous shall endure for ever, and their memory shall be always green ; the ungodly man and his name shall rot from off the face of the eaith. He desired to be the founder of a family, and to be temembered as some great one: he shall pass away and his name shall die with him. How wide is the gulf which separates the righteous from the wicked, and how different are the portions which the Lord deals out to them. O for grace to be blessed of the Lord! This will make us praise him with our whole heart.</p>

Now I make no doubt that there is at least somewhat of that intenser meaning carried up into the higher region of spiritual experience, and expressed by the text, &quot;Unto the upright there ariseth light in the damness.&quot; . . .
