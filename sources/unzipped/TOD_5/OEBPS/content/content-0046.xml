What, then, must be his condescension, seeing that he observes the humblest of his servants upon earth, and makes them sing for joy like Maiy when she said, &quot;Thou hast regarded the low estate of thine handmaiden.&quot; How wonderful are those words of Isaiah, &quot;For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.&quot; Heathen philosophers could not believe that the great God was observant of the small events of human history; they pictured him as abiding in serene indifference to all the wants and woes of his creatures. &quot;Our Rock is not as their rock &quot; ; we have a God who is high above all gods, and yet who is our Father, knowing what we have need of before we ask him; our Shepherd, who supplies our needs; our Guardian, who counts the hairs of our heads; our tender and considerate Friend, who sympathizes in all our griefs.

His good Spirit is continually visiting the down-trodden, giving beauty for ashes to those who are cast down, and elevating the hearts of his mourners till they shout for joy. These upliftiugs of grace are here ascribed directly to the divine hand, and truly those who have experienced them will Dot doubt the fact that it is the Lord alone who brings his people up from the dust of sorrow and death. When no hand but his can help he interposes, and the work is done. It is worth while to be cast down to be so divinely raised from the dust. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lifteth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tlie </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>needy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dunghill,&quot; </span>whereon they lay like worthless refuse, cast off and cast out, left as they thought to rot into destruction, and to be everlastingly forgotten. How great a stoop from the height of his throne to a dunghill! How wonderful that power which occupies itself in lifting up beggars, all befouled with the filthiness in which they lay! For he lifts them <span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span>op the dunghill, not disdaining to search them out from amidst the base things of the earth that he may by their means bring to nought the great ones, and pour contempt upon all human glorying. What a dunghill was that upon which we lay by nature! What a mass of corruption is our original estate! What a heap of loathsomeness we have accumulated by our sinful lives! What reeking abominations surround us in the society of our fellow men! We could never have risen out of all this by our own efforts, it was a sepulchre in which we saw corruption, and were as dead men. Almighty were the arms which lifted us, which arc still lifting us, and will lift us into the perfection of heaven itself. Praise ye the Lord.</p>

favours among the princes of princes. He often enables those who have been most despairing to rise to the greatest heights of spirituality and gracious attainment, for those who once were last shall be first. Paul, though less than the least of all saints, was. nevertheless, made to be not a whit behind the very chief of the apostles; and in our own times, Bunyan, the blaspheming tinker, was raised into another John, whose dream almost rivals the visions of the Apocalypse.</span></p>

The glorious Lord displays his condescending grace in regarding those who are despised on account of their barrenness, whether it be of body or of soul. Sarah, Rachel, the wife of Manoah, Hannah, Elizabeth, and otheis were all instances of the miraculous power of God in literally fulfilling the statement of the psalmist. Women were not supposed to have a house till they had childien; but in certain cases where childless women pined in secret the Loid visited them in mercy, and made them not only to have a house, but to keep it. The Gentile church is a spiritual example upon a large scale of the gift of fruitfulness after long years of hopeless barrenness; and the Jewish church in the latter days will be another amazing display of the same quickening power: long forsaken for her spiritual adultery, Israel shall be forgiven, anil lestored, and joyously shall she keep that house which now is left unto her desolate. Nor is this all, each believer in the Lord Jesus must at tiroes have mourned his lamentable barrenness; he has appeared to be a dry tree yielding no fruit to the Lord, and yet when visited by the Holy Ghost, he has found himself suddenly to be like Aaron&#39;s rod, which budded, and blossomed, and brought foilh almonds. Or ever we have been aware, our barren heart has kept house, and entertained the Saviour, our graces have been multiplied as if uinny children had come to us at a single birth, and we have exceedingly rejoiced before the Lord. Then have we marvelled greatly at the Lord who dwelleth on high, that he has deigned to visit such poor worthless things. Like Mary, we have lifted up our Magnificat, and like Hannah, we have said, &quot;There is none holy as the Lord ; for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like our God.&quot;</p>
<a id='GBS.PA242.w.1.4.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.263.1.4.box.310.1815.1292.461.q.60'>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Pru</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord.&quot; </span>The music concludes upon its key-note. The psalm is a circle, ending where it began, praising the Lord from its first syllable to its last. May our life-psalm partake of the same character, and never know a break or a conclusion. In an endless circle let us bless the Lord, whose mercies never cease. Let us praise him in youth, and all along our yenrs of strength; and when we bow in the ripeness of abundant age, let us still praise the Lord, who doth not cast off his old servants. Let us not only praise God ourselves, but exhort others to do it; and if we meet with any of the needy who have been enriched, and with the barren who have been made fruitful, let us join with them in extolling the name of him whose mercy endureth for ever. Having been ourselves lifted from spiritual beggary and barrenness, let us never forget our former estate or the grace which has visited us, but world without end let us praise the Lord. Hallelujah.</p>

This repetition is not without significance. It is for the purpose of waking us up out of our torpor. We are all too dull and slow in considering and praising the blessings of God. There is, therefore, necessity for these stimuli. Then this repetition signifies assiduity and perseverance in sounding foith the praises of God. It is not sufficient once and again to praise God, but his praises ought to be always sung in the Church.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Mollerus. </span></p>

This is to praise God, without which all other courting and complimenting of him is but mere flattery and hypocrisy. . . . God Almighty endowed us with higher and nobler faculties than other creatures, for this end, that we should set forth his praise; for though other things were made to administer the matter and occasion, yet man alone was designed and qualified to exercise the act of glorifying God. ...

His first answer, I giant, is, that all things have not continued as they were from the creation, for thcie was a flood of waters, and those who said, Where is the promise of his coming? in the days of Noah were at last answered by the bursting earth and the breaking</p>

For when John the Baptist sent two disciples to Jesus, to know whether he was the Messiah or not, the answer of our Lord was, &quot;The blind see, the lepers are cleansed, the dead are raised &quot;&#8212;all extraordinary events&#8212;miracles, in short, which proved his divine commission. And he summed up the whole by saying, &quot; The poor have the gospel preached unto them;&quot; as great a miracle as any&#8212;as great a distinction as any. There never was a religion but the true religion, in all its various dispensations, that hud equal respect to all classes of society. In all others there was a privileged class, but here there is none. Perhaps one of the most interesting views of Chiistianity we can take is its wonderful adaptation to the character and circumstances of the poor. What an opportunity does it furnish for the manifestation of the bright and mild graces of the Holy Spirit! What sourr es of comfort does it open to mollify the troubles of life! and how often, in c hoosing the poor, rich in faith, to make them heirs of the kingdom, does God exalt the poor out of the dust, and the needy from the dunghill !&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Richard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Watson. </span></p>
