It will he well to remember that this psalm was sung at the Passover, and therefore it bears relationship to the deliverance from Egypt. The burden of it seems to bo a prayer that the living God, who had been so glorious at the Ked Sea and at the Jordan, should again for his own name&#39;s sake display the wonders of his power. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>but </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory.&#39;&#39; </span>The people undoubtedly wished for relief from the contemptuous insults of idolaters, but their main desire was that Jehovah himself should no longer be the object of heathen insults. The saddest part of all their trouble was that their God was no longer feared and dreaded by their adversaries. When Israel marched into Canaan, a terror was upon all the people round about, because of Jehovah, the mighty God; but this dread the nations had shaken off since there had been of late no remarkable display of miraculous power. Therefore I*rael cried unto her God that he would again make hare his arm as in the day when he cut Rahab and wounded the dragon. The prayer is evidently tinctured with a consciousness of unworthiness; because of their past unfaithfulness they hardly dared to appeal to the covenant, and to ask blessings for themselves, but they fell back upon the honour of the Lord their God&#8212;an old style of argument which their great lawgiver, Moses, had used with such effect when he pleaded, &quot; Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.&quot; Joshua also used the like argument when he said, &quot;What wilt thou do unto thy great name?&quot; In such manner also let us pray when no other plea is available because of our sense<a id='GBS.PA264.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.285.1.0.box.288.293.1288.65.q.50'>

They loathed the idea of seeking their own glory, and rejected the thought with the utmost detestation ; again and again disclaiming any self-glorifying motive in their supplication. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fur </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth?t </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>vake.&quot; </span>These attributes seemed most in jeopardy. How could the heathen think Jehovah to be a merciful God if he gave his people over to the hands of their enemies? How could they believe him to be faithlul and true if, after all his solemn covenant engagements, he utterly iejected his chosen nation? God is very jealous of the two glorious attributes of grace and truth, and the plea that these may not be dishonoured has great weight with him. In these times, when the first victories of the gospel are only remembered as histories of a dim and distant past, scepties are apt to boast that the gospel has lost its youthful strength, and they even presume to cast a slur upon the name of God himself. We may therefore rightly entreat the divine interposition that the apparent blot may be removed from his escutcheon, and that his own word may shine foith gloriously as in the days of old. We may not desire the triumph of our opinions, for our own sakes, or for the honour of a sect, but we may confidently pray for the triumph of truth, that God himself may be honoured.</p>

They arc always ready to blaspheme; we may well pray that they may not derive a reason for so doing from the course of providence, or the decline of the church. When they sec the godly down-trodden while they themselves live at ease, and act the part of persecutors, they are very apt to speak as if they had triumphed over God himself, or as if he had altogether left the field of action and deserted his saints. When the prayers and teais of the godly seem to be unregarded, and their miseries are rather increased than assuaged, then do the wicked multiply their taunts and jeers, and even argue that their own wretched irreligion is better than the faith of Christians, because for the present their condition is so much preferable to that of the afflicted saint3. And, truly, this is the very sting of the trials of God&#39;s chosen when they see the veracity of the Lord questioned, and the name of God profaned because of their sufferings. If they could hope that some good result would come out of all this they would endure it with patience ; but as they are unable to perceive any desirable result consequent thereon, they enquire with holy anxiety, &quot;Wherefore should the heathen be permitted to speak thus if&quot; It is a question to which it would be hard to reply, and yet no doubt thire is an answer. Sometimes the nations are permitted thus to blaspheme, in order that they may fill up the measure of their iniquity, and in order that the subsequent interposition of God may be rendered the more illustrious in contrast with their profane boastings.

In our own case, by our own lukewarmness and the neglect of faithful gospel preaching, we have permitted the uprise and spread of modern doubt, and we are bound to confess it with deep sorrow of soul ; yet we may not therefore lose heart, but may stilll plead with God to save his own truth and grace from the contempt of men of the world. Our honour and the honour of the church are small matters, but the glory of God is the jewel of the universe, of which all else is but the Betting; and we may come to the Lord and plead his jealousy for his name,<a id='GBS.PA265.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.286.1.0.box.130.296.1310.392.q.60'>
being well assured that he will not suffer that name to be dishonoured. Wherefore should the pretended wise men of the period be permitted to say that they doubt the personality of God? Wherefore should they say that answers to prayer are pious delusions, and that the resurrection and the deity of our Lord Jesus are moot points? Wherefore should they be peimitted to speak dispaiagingly of atonement by blood and by price, and reject utterly the doctrine of the wrath of God against sin, even that wrath which burnetii for ever and ever? They speak exceeding proudly, and only God can stop their arrogant blusterings : let us by extraordinary intercession prevail upon him to interpose, by giving to his gospel such a triumphant vindication as shall utterly silence the perverse opposition of ungodly men.</span></p>

If our God be neither seen nor heard, and is not to be worshipped under any outward symbol, yet is he none the less real and true, for he is where his adversaries can never be&#8212;in the heavens, whence he stretches forth his sceptre, and rules with boundless power.</p>

Our God is a spirit, and his hands made the heavens and the earth : well may we worship him, and we need not be disturbed at the sneering question of those who are so insane as to refuse to adore the living God, and yet bow their knees before images of their own carving. We may make an application of all this to the times in which we arc now living. The god of modern thought is the creation of the thinker himself, evolved out of his own consciousness, or fashioned according to his own notion of what a god should be. Now, it is evident that such a being is no God. It is impossible that there should be a God at all except the God of revelation. A god who can be fashioned by our own thoughts is no more a God than the image manufactured or produced by our own hands. The true God must of necessity be his own revealer. It is clearly impossible that a being who can be excogitated and compiehended by the reason of man should be the infinite and incomprehensible God. Their idols are blinded reason and diseased thought, the pioduct of men&#39;s muddled brains, and they will come to nought.</p>

Pantheism is wondrously akin to Polytheism, and yet differs very little from Atheism. The god manufactured by our great thinkers is a mere abstraction: he has no eternal purposes, he does not interpose on the behalf of his people, he cares but very little as to how much man sins, for he has given to the initiated &quot;a larger hope&quot; by which the most incorrigible are to be restored. He is what the last set of crities chooses to make him, he has said what they choose to say, and he will do what they please to prescribe. Let this creed and its devotees alone, and they will work out their own refutation, for as now their god is fashioned like themselves, they will by degrees fashion themselves like their god ; and when the principles of justice, law, and order shall have all been effectually sapped we may possibly witness in some form of socialism, similar to that which is so sadly spreading in Germany, a repetition of the evils which have in former ages befallen nations which have refused the living God, and set up gods of their own.</p>

All this would be very staggering to faith, and therefore they were bidden again and again and again to trust in Jehovah.</p>

The free agency which he gave to his creatures necessitated that in some degree he should restmin his power and suffer the children of men to follow their own devices ; yet nevertheless, since he has not vacated heaven, he is still master of earth, and can at any time gather up all the reins into his own hands. Perhaps, however, the passage is meant to have another meaning, viz., that God will increase his people, because he has given the earth to them, and intends that they shall fill it. Man was constituted originally God&#39;s vicegerent over the world, and though as yet we see not all things put under him, we see Jesus exalted on high, and in him the children of men shall receive a loftier dominion even on earth than as yet they have known. &quot;The meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves<a id='GBS.PA270.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.291.1.0.box.290.278.1296.212.q.60'>

The spiritually dead cannot praise God, but the life within us constrains us to do so. The ungodly may abide in silence, but we will lift up our voices to the praise of Jehovah. Even though for a time he may work no miracle, and we may see no peculiar interposition of his power, yet on the strength of what he has done in ages past we will continue to laud his name &quot; until the day break, and the shadows flee away,&quot; when he shall once more shine forth as the sun to gladden the faces of his children. The present time is auspicious for commencing a life of praise, since to-day he bids us hear his voice of mercy. &quot;From this time forth&quot; is the suggestion of wisdom, for this duty ought not to be delayed ; and it is the dictate of gratitude, for there are pressing reasons for prompt thankfulness.

And could we see heaven opened&#8212;could we hear its glad and glorious hallelujahs&#8212;could we see its innumerable company of angels, and its band of glorified saints, as they cast their crowns before the throne, we should hear as the universal chorus from every lip, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>but </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sake.&#39;&#39; </span>I know not why this should not be as gladly and as gratefully the angels&#39; song as the song of the redeemed : they stand not in their own might nor power,&#8212;they kept not their first estate through any inherent strength of their own, but, like their feebler brethren of the human race, are equally &quot;kept by the power of God &quot;; and from their ranks, I doubt not, is re-echoed the same glorious strain, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>but </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>glory.&#39;&#39; </span>Even our blessed Lord, as on that night of sorrow he sung this hymn of praise, could truly say, in that nature which had sinned, and which was to suffer, &quot;Not unto us,&quot;&#8212;not unto man, be ascribed the glory of this great salvation, which I am now with my own blood to purchase, but unto thy name and thy love be the praise given.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Barton </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bouchier. </span></p>
