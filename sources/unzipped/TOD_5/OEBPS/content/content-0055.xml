This he termeth <span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cup, </span>because that drink-offering was contained in a cup and poured out thereof; and he adds this epithet, &quot;salvation,&quot; because that rite was an acknowledgment of salvation, pieservation and deliverance from the Lord.</p>

Hereby is implied that he made so beautiful a feast, as he had to give theieof to all the people there assembled. In this feast the master thereof was wont to take a great cup, and in lifting it up to declare the occasion of that feast, and then in testimony of thankfulness to drink thereof to the guests, that they in order might pledge him. This was called a cup of salvation, or deliverance, becaui-e they acknowledged by the use thereof that God had saved and delivered them. Almost in a like sense the apostle styleth the sacramental cup, the cup of blessing. Here the prophet useth the plural number, thus, &quot;cup of <span style='font-style:italic;'>salvations,&quot; </span>whereby, after the Hebrew elegancy, he meaneth many deliverances, one after another; or some great and extraordinary deliverance which was instead of many, or which comprised many under it.

Most of our later expositors of this psalm apply this phrase, &quot;I will take the cup of salvation,&quot; to the forenamed gratulatory drink-offering, or to the taking and lifting up of the cup of blessing in the feast, after the solemn sacrifice. Both of these import one and the same thing, which is, that saints of old were wont to testifv their gratefulness for great deliverances with some outward sokmu rite.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gouge. </span></p>

In the next place, I think the death of the saints is precious in the Lord&#39;s sight, because <span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>taken </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evil </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>come; </span>they are delivered from the burden of the flesh; ransomed by the blood of the Redeemer, they are his purchased possession, and now he receives them to himself. Sin and sorrow for ever cease; there is no more death, the death of Christ is their redemption; by death he overcame him that had the power of death; therefore, they in him are enabled to say, &quot;O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?&quot; Again, the death of the saints is precious in the Lord&#39;s right, for in it <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>often </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sves </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>very </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>finest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>evi</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dences </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>work </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>own </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Spirit </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>he sees faith in opposition to sense, leaning upon the promises of God.

Again, the death of the saints is precious in the Lord&#39;s sight, <span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>draws </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tendernesses </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>surviving </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Christian </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>friends, </span>and is abundant in the thanksgivings of many an anxious heart; it elicits the sympathies of Christian charity, and realises that communion of saints, of which the Apostle speaks, when he says, &quot;if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; if one &#8226;rejoice they all joy.&quot; ....

This sentiment will admit, perhaps, of a third illustration; <span style='font-style:italic;'>trhen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saints </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>dying, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>looks </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>merciful </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them. </span>Who can say how often he answers prayer, even-in the cases of dying believers? Never does he fail to support, even where he does not see good to spare. By the whispers of his love, by the witness of his Spirit, by the assurance of his presence, by the preparatory revelation of heavenly glory, he strengthens his afflicted ones, he makes all their bed in their sickness. Ah! and when, perhaps, they scarcely possess a bed to languish upon, when poverty or other calamitous circumstances leave them, in the sorrow of sickness, no place of repose but the bare ground for their restless bodies, and his bosom for their spirits, do they ever find God fail them? No; many a holy man has slept the sleep of death with the missionary Martyn, in a strange and inhospitable land, or with the missionary Smith, upon the floor of a dungeon, and yet &quot;Jesus has made their dying bed As soft us downy pillows are.&quot;</p>

It is possible, certainly, to make too much of it, by substituting, as a criterion of character, that which may be professed under the excitement of dying sufferings, for the testimony of a uniform, conspicuous career of holy living. But it is equally indefensible, and even ungrateful to God, to make too little of it, to make too little account of a good end, when connected with a good beginning and with a patient continuance in well-doing.</p>

Rain descends upon the earth, not that it might be more barren, but more fertile. We are but stewards; the mercies we enjoy are not our own, but to be improved for our Master&#39;s service. Great mercies should engage to great obedience. God begins the Decalogue with a memorial of his mercy in bringing the Israelites out of Egypt,&#8212;&#39;<sup>;</sup>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.&quot; How affectionately doth the psalmist own his relation to God as his servant, when he considers how God had loosed his bonds: &quot;0 <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>am </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servant; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hast </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>loosed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>oouds!&quot; </span>the remembrance of thy mercy shall make me know no relation but that of a servant to thee. When we remember what wages we have from God, wo must withal remember that we owe mure service, and more liveliness in service, to him. Duty is but the ingenuous consequent of mercy. It is irrational to encourage ourselves in our way to hell by a remembrance of heaven, to foster a liberty in sin by a consideration of God&#39;s bounty. When we remember that all we have or are is the gift of God&#39;s liberality, we should think ourselves obliged to honour him with all that we have, for he is to have honour from all his gifts. It is a sign we aimed at God&#39;s glory in begging mercy, when we also aim at God&#39;s glory in enjoying it. It is a sign that love breathed the remembrance of mercy into our hearts, when at the same time it breathes a resolution into us to improve it. It is not our tongues, but our lives must praise him. Mercies are not given to one member, but to the whole man.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Stephen </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Charnock. </span></p>
