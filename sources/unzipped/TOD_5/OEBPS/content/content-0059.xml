He speedily ceased from the chastisements which they so richly deserved, because he had a favour towards them. He put his rod away the moment they lepented, because his heart was full of compassion. &quot;H:s mercy endureth for ever&quot; was Israel&#39;s national hymn, which, as a people, they had been called upon to sing upon many former occasions; and now their leader, who had at last gained the place for which Jehovah had destined him, calls upon the whole nation to join with him in extolling, in this particular instance of the divine goodness, the eternal mercy of the Lord. Dav d&#39;s success was mercy to Israel, as well as mercy to himself. If Israel does not sing, who will? If Israel does not sing of mercy, who can? If Israel does not sing when the Son of David ascends the throne, the very stones will cry out.</p>

Every time the morning and evening lamb was sacrificed, the priests saw the continual mercy of the Lord, and in all the holy vessels of the sanctuary, and all its services from hour to hour, they had renewed witness of the goodness of the Most High. AVhen the high priest went in unto the holy place and came forth accepted, he might, above all men, sing of the eternal mercy. If this psalm refers to David, the priests had special reason for thankfulness on his coming to the throne, for Saul had made a great slaughter among them, and had at various times interfered with their sacred office. A man had now come to the throne who for their Master&#39;s sake would esteem them, give them their dues, and preserve them safe from all harm. Our Lord Jesus, having made all his people priests unto God, may well call upon them in that capacity to magnify the everlasting mercy of the Most High. Can any one of the royal priesthood be silent?</p>

The prosperity of Israel through the reign of David was a blessing to all who feared Jehovah. A truly God-fearing man will have his eye much upon God&#39;s marcy, because he is deeply conscious of his need of it, and because that attribute excites in him a deep feeling of reverential awe. &quot;There is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared.&quot;</p>

God would have his people act as witnesses, and not stand silent in the day when his honour is impugned. Specially is it our joy to speak out to the honour and glory of God when we think upon the exaltation of his dear Son. We should shout &quot;Hosannah,&quot; and sing loud &quot;Hallelujahs&#39;&#39; when we behold the stone which the builders rejected lifted into its proper place.</p>

Here are four cords to bind the sacrifice to the four horns of the altar, and four trumpets with which to proclaim the year of jubilee to every quarter of the world. Let not the reader pass on to the consideration of the rest of the psalm until he has with all his might lifted up both heart and voice to praise the Lord, &quot;for his mercy endureth for ever.&quot;</span></p>

Prayers which come out of distress generally come out of the heart, and therefore they go to the heart of God. It is sweet to recollect our prayers, and often profitable to tell others of them after they are heard. Prayer may be bitter in the offering, but it will be sweet in the answering. The man of God had called upon the Lord when he was not in distress, and therefore he found it natural and easy to call upon him when he was in distress. He worshipped, he praised, he<a id='GBS.PA323.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.344.1.0.box.161.298.1308.890.q.60'>
prayed: for all this is included in calling upon God, even when he was in a straitened condition. Some read the original &quot; a narrow gorge&quot; ; and therefore it was the more joy to him when he could say &quot; The Lord answered me, and set me in a large place.&quot; He passed out of the defile of distress into the well-watered plain of delight. He says, &quot;Jah heard mo in a wide place,&quot; for God is never shut up, or straitened. In God&#39;s case hearing means answering, hence the translators rightly put, &quot;The Lord answered me,&quot; though the original word is &quot;/iearti.&quot; The answer was appropriate to the prayer, for he brought him out of his narrow and confined condition into a place of liberty where he could walk at large, free from obstruction and oppression. Many of us can join with the psalmist in the declarations of this verse; deep was our distress on account of sin, and we were shut up as in a prison under the law, but in answer to the prayer of faith we obtained the liberty of full justification wherewith Christ makes men free, and we are free indeed. It was the Lord who did it, and unto his name we ascribe all the glory; we had no merits, no strength, no wisdom, all we could do was to call upon him, and even that was his gift; but the mercy which is to eternity came to our rescue, we were brought out of bondage, and we were made to delight ourselves in the length and breadth of a boundless inheritance. What a large place is that in which the great God has placed us! All things ure ours, all times are ours, all places are ours, for God himself is ours; we have earth to lodge in and heaven to dwell in,&#8212;what larger place can be imagined <span style='font-style:italic;'>i </span>We need all Israel, the whole house of Aaron, and all them that fear the Lord, to assist us in the expression of our gratitude; and when they have aided us to the utmost, and we ourselves have done our best, all will fall short of the praises that are due to our gracious Lord.</span></p>

The Psalmist naturally rejoiced in the divine help; all men turned against him, but God was his defender and advocate, accomplishing the divine purposes of his grace. The expression may also be translated &quot; to me,&quot; that is to say, Jehovah belongs to ma, and is mine. What infinite wealth is here!

God having purposed to set his servant upon the throne, the whole race of mankind could do nothing to thwart the divine decree: the settled purpose of Jehovah&#39;s heart could not be turned aside, nor its accomplishment delayed, much less prevented, by the most rancorous hostility of the most powerful of men. Saul sought to slay David, but David outlived Saul, and sat upon his throne. Scribe and Pharisee, priest and Herodian, united in opposing the Christ of God, but he is exalted on high none the less because of their enmity. The mightiest man is a puny thing when he stands in opposition to God, yea, he shrinks into utter nothingness. It were a pity to be afraid of such a pitiful, miserable, despicable object as a man opposed to the almighty God. The psalmist here speaks like a champion throwing down the gauntlet to all comers, defying the universe in aims; a true Bayard, without fear and without reproach, he enjoys God&#39;s favour, and he defies every foe.</p>

is a long record of David&#39;s mighty men in the book of Chronicles, and this teaches us that wtj are not to disdain or think little of the generous friends who rally around us; but still our great dependence and our grand confidence must be fixed upon the Lord alone.

It is also morally better to do so, for it is the duty of the creature to trust in the Creator. God has a claim upon his creatures&#39; faith, he deserves to be trusted ; and to place our reliance upon another rather than upon himself, is a direct insult to his faithfulness. It is better in the sense of safer, since we can never be sure of our ground if we rely upon mortal man, but we are always secure in the hands of our God. It is better in its effect upon ourselves: to trust in man tends to make us mean, crouching, dependent; but confidence in God elevates, produces a sacred quiet of spirit, and sanctifies the soul. It is, moreover, much better to trust in God, as far as the result is concerned ; for in many cases the human object of our trust fails from want of abihty, from want of generosity, from want of affection, or from want of memory; but the Lord, so far from failing, does for us exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or even think. This verse is written out of the experience of many who have first of all found the broken reeds of the creature break under them, and have afterwards joyfully found the Lord to bo a solid pillar sustaining all their weight.</p>

A gilded vane turns with the wind as readily as a meaner weathercock. Princes are but men, and the best of men are poor creatures. In many troubles they cannot help us in the least degree: for instance, in sickness, bereavement, or death ; neither can they assist us one jot in reference to our eternal state. In eternity a prince&#39;s smile goes for nothing; heaven and hell pay no homage to royal authority. The favour of princes is proverbially fickle, the testimonies of worldhngs to this effect are abundant.

yea, the manliness which the meanest slave retains has been basely bartered for the stars and garters of a profligate monarch. He who puts his confidence in God, the great King, is thereby made mentally and spiritually stronger, and rises to the highest dignity of manhood; in fact, the more he trusts the more is he free, but the fawning sycophant of greatness is meaner than the dirt he treads upon. For this reason and a thousand others it is infinitely better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.</span></p>

He was hemmed in by his adversaries, and scarce could find a loophole of escape from the bands which made a ring around him. As if by common consent all sorts of people set themselves against him, and yet he was more than a match for them all, because he was trusting in the name of the Lord. Therefore does he joyfully accept the battle, and grasp the victory, crying, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>but </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>destroy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them,&quot; </span>or &quot;cut them in pieces.&quot; They thought to destroy <span style='font-style:italic;'>him, </span>but he was sure of destroying <span style='font-style:italic;'>them</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>; </span>they meant to blot out his name, but he expected to render not only his own name but the name of the Lord his God more illustrious in the hearts of men. It takes grand faith to be calm in the day of actual battle, and especially when that battle waxes hot; but our hero was as calm as if no fight was raging. Napoleon said that God was always on the side of the biggest battalions, but the psalmist-warrior found that the Lord of hosts was with the solitary champion, and that in his name the battalions were cut to pieces. There is a grand touch of the <span style='font-style:italic;'>ego </span>in the last sentence, but it is so overshadowed with the name of the Lord that there is none too much of it. He recognized his own individuality, and asserted it: he did not sit still supinely and leave the work to be done by God by some mysterious means; but he resolved with his own trusty sword to set abt ut the enterprise, and so become in God&#39;s hand the instrument of his own deliverance. He did all in the name of the Lord, but he did not ignore his own responsibility, nor screen himself from personal conflict, for he cried, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;1 </span>will destroy them.&quot; Observe that be does not speak of merely escaping from them like a bird out of the snare of the fowler, but he vows that he will carry the war into his enemies&#39; ranks, and overthrow them so thoroughly that there should be no fear of their rising up a second time.</p>

We see their fierce array, and their cruel combination of forces. They made a double ring, they surrounded him in a circle of many ranks, they not only talked of doing so, but they actually shut him up and enclosed him as within a wall. His heart had vividly realized his position of peril at the time, and now he d.;lights to call it again to mind in order that he may the more ardently adore the mercy which made him strong in the hour of conflict, so that he broke through a troop, yea, swept a host to destruction. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mime </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>destroy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>I will subdue them, get them under my feet, and break tneir power in pieces. He is as certain about the destruction of his enemies as he was assured of their having compassed him about. They made the circle three and four times deep, but for all that he felt confident of victory. It is grand to hear a man speak in this fashion when it is not ho.wting, but the calm declaration of his heartfelt trust in God.</p>

They were soon hot and soon cold, their attack was as short as it was sharp. He had no need to crush the bees, for like crackling thorns they died out of themselves.

He thrust again and again with the keenest point, even as bees tinust their stings into their victim. The foe had exhibited intense exasperation, and fearful determination, nor had he been without a measure of success; wounds had been given and received, and these smarted much, and were exceeding sore.

If our adversaries can do this they will have succeeded to their heart&#39;s content: if we fall into grievous sin they will be better pleased thtuj even if they had sent the bullet of the assassin into our heart, for a moral death is worse than a physical one. If they can dishonour us, and God in us, their victory will be complete. &quot;Better death than false of faith&quot; is the motto of one of our noble houses, and it may well be ours.

He is cheerfully assured that no arrow could carry death between the joints of his harness, and no weapon of any sort could end his career. His time had not yet come, he felt immortality beating wilhin his bosom. Perhaps he had been sick, and brought to death&#39;s door, but he had a presentiment that the sickness was not unto ileath, but to the glory of God. At any rate, he knew that he should not so die as to give victory to the enemies of God; for the honour of God and the good of his people were both wrapped up in his continued success. Feeling that he would live he devoted himself to the noblest of purposes: he resolved to bear witness to the divine faithfulness, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>declare </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord.&quot; </span>He determined to recount the works of Jah ; and he does so in this psalm, wherein he dwells with love and admiration upon the splendour of Jehovah&#39;s prowess in the midst of the fight. While there is a testimony for God to be borne by us to any one, it is certain that we shall not be hurried from the land of the living. The Lord&#39;s prophets shall live on in the midst of famine, and war, and plague, and persecution, till they have uttered all the words of their prophecy; his priests shall stand at the altar unharmed till their last sacrifice has been presented before him. No bullet will find its billet in our hearts till we have finished our allotted period of activity.</p>

The devil tormented Job for his own purposes, but in reality the sorrows of the patriarch were chastisements from the Lord. &quot;Chastening, Jah hath chastened me,&quot; says our poet: as much as to say that the Lord had smitten him very severely, and made him sorrowfully to know the full weight of his rod. The Lord frequently appears to save his heaviest blows for his best-beloved ones; if any one affliction be more painful than another it falls to the lot of those whom he most distinguishes in his service. The gardener prunes his best roses with most care. Chastisement is sent to keep successful saints humble, to make them tender towards others, and to enable them to bear the high honours which their heavenly Friend puts upon them. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;But </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wot </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>given </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>orer </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>death.&#39;&#39; </span>This verse, like the thirteenth, concludes with a blessed &quot; but,&quot; which constitutes a saving clause. The psalmist felt as if he had been beaten within an inch of his life, but yet death did not actually ensue. There is always a merciful limit to the scourging of the sons of God. Forty sripes save one were all that an Israelite might receive, and the Lord will never allow that one, that killing stroke, to fall upon his children. They are &quot;chastened, but not killed&quot; ; their pains are for their instruction, not for their destruction. By these things the ungodly die, but gracious Hczi-kiah could say, &quot;By these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit.&quot; No, blessed be the name of God, he may chastise us, but he will not condemn us; we must feel the smarting rod, but we shall not feel the killing sword. He does not give us over unto death at any time, and we may be quite sure that he has not done so while he condescends to chasten us, for if he intended our final rejection he would not take the pains to place us under his fatherly discipline. It may seem hard to be under the afflicting rod, but it would be a far more dreadful thing if the Lord were to say, &#39;&#8226; He is given unto idols, let him alone.&quot; Even from our griefs we may distil consolation, and gather sweet flowers from the garden in which the Lord has planted salutary<a id='GBS.PA329.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.350.1.0.box.166.296.1299.106.q.60'>

The temple of God was meant for the righteous to enter and offer the sacrifices of righteousness, hence the gates are called the gates of righteousness. Righteous deeds were done within its walls, and righteous teachings sounded forth from its courts. The phrase &quot;the gate&quot; is sometimes used to signify power or empire; as, for instance, &quot;the Sublime Porte&quot; signifies the seat of empire of Turkey; the entrance to the temple was the true Sublime Porte, and what is better, it was the <span style='font-style:italic;'>porta </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>justitm. </span>the gate of righteousness, the palace of the great King, who is in all things just. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>go </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord.&quot; </span>Only let the gate be opened, and the willing worshipper will enter; and he will enter in the right spirit, and for the best of purposes, that he may render homage unto the Most High. Alas, there are multitudes who do not care whether the gates of God&#39;s house are opened or not; and although they know that they are opened wide they never care to enter, neither does the thought of praising God so much as cross their minds. The time will come for them when they shall find the gates of heaven shut against them, for those gates are peculiarly the gates of righteousness through which there shall by no means enter anything that defileth. Our champion might have praised the Lord in secret, and doubtless he did so; but he was not content without going up to the assembly, there to register his thanksgivings. Those who neglect public worship generally neglect all worship; those who praise God within their own gates are among the readiest to praise him within his temple gates. Our hero had also in all probability been sore sick, and therefore like Hezekiah he says, &quot;The Lord was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of my life in the house of the Lord.&quot; Public praise for public mercies is every way most appropriate, most acceptable to God, and most profitable to others.</p>

He loved it because it was the gate of the Lord, he loved it because it was the gate of righteousness, because so many godly people had already entered it, and because in all future ages such persons will continue to pass through its portals. If the gate of the Lord&#39;s house on earth is so pleasant to us, bow greatly shall we rejoice when we pass that gate of pearl, to which none but the righteous shall ever approach, but through which all the just shall in due time enter to eternal felicity. The Lord Jesus has passed that way, and not only set the gate wide opeu, but secured an entrance for all those who are made righteous in his righteousness: all the righteous must and shall enter there, whoever may oppose them. Under another aspect our Lord is himself that gate, and through him,<a id='GBS.PA330.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.351.1.0.box.269.282.1294.215.q.60'>
as the new and living Way, all the righteous delight to approach unto the Lord. Whenever we draw near to praise the Lord we must come by this gate; acceptable praise never climbs over the wall, or enters by any other way, but comes to God in Christ Jesus; as it is written, &quot;no man cometh unto the Father but by me.&quot; Blessed, for ever blessed, be this wondrous gate of the person of our Lord.</span></p>

How well it is in all our songs of praise to let the heart have direct and distinct communion with God himself! The psalmist&#39;s song was personal praise too :&#8212;&quot;/will praise thee&quot;; resolute praise, for he firmly resolved to offer it; spontaneous praise, for he voluntarily and cheerfully rendered it, and continuous praise, for he did not intend soon to have done with it. It was a life-long vow to which there would never come a close, &quot;I will praise thee.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;For </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hatt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>become </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>salvation.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>He praises God by mentioning his favours, weaving his song out of the divine goodness which he had experienced. In these words he gives the reason for his praise,&#8212;his answered prayer, and the deliverance which ho had received in consequence. How fondly he dwells upon the personal interposition of God! <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span>hast heard me.&quot; How heartily he ascribes the whole of his victory over his enemies to God; nay, he sees God himself to be the whole of it: <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span>art become my salvation.&quot; It is well to go directly to God himself, and not to stay even in his mercy, or in the acts of his grace. Answered prayers bring God very near to us; realised salvation enables us to realise the immediate presence of God. Considering the extreme distress through which the worshipper had passed, it is not at all wonderful that he should feel his heart full of gratitude at the great salvation which God had wrought for him, and should at his first entrance into the temple lift up his voice in thankful praise for personal favours so great, so needful, so perfect.</p>

A wise king and valiant leader is a stono by which the national fabric is built up. David had been rejected by those in authority, but God had placed him in a position of the highest honour and the greatest usefulness, making him the chief corner-stone of the state. In the case of many others whose early life has been spent in conflict, the Lord has been pleased to accomplish his divine purposes in like manner; but to none is this text so applicable as to the Lord Jesus himself: he is the living stone, the tried stone, elect, precious, which God himself appointed from of old.

They could see no excellence in him that they should build upon him; he could not be made to fit in with their ideal of a national church, he was a stone of another quarry from themselves, and not after their mind nor according to their taste; therefore they cast him away and poured contempt upon him, even as Peter said, &quot;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders&quot;; they reckoned him to be as nothing, though he is Lord of all. In raising him from the dead the Lord God exalted him to be the head of his church, the very pinnacle of her glory and beauty. Since then he has become the confidence of the Gentiles, even of them that are afar off upon the sea, and thus he has joined the two walls of Jew and Gentile into one stately.temple, and is seen to be the binding corner-stone, making both one. This is a delightful subject for contemplation.</span></p>

We are accustomed to lay some one stone of a public building with solemn ceremony, and to deposit in it any precious things which may have been selected as a memorial of the occasion: henceforth that corner-stone is looked upon as peculiarly honourable, and joyful memories are associated with it. All this is in a very emphatic sense true of our blessed Lord, &quot;The Shepherd, the Stone of Israel.&quot; God himself laid him where he is, and hid within him all the precious things of the eternal covenant; and there he shall for ever remain, the foundation of all our hopes, the glory of all our joys, the united bond of all our fellowship. He is &quot; the head over all things to the church,&quot; and by him the church is fitly framed together, and groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. S.ill do the builders refuse him : even to this day the professional teachers of the gospel are far too apt to fly to any and every new philosophy sooner than maintain the simple gospel, which is the essence of Christ: nevertheless, he holds his true position amongst his people, and the foolish builders shall see to their utter confusion that his truth shall be exalted over all.

Considering the opposition which comes from the wisdom, the power, and the authority of this world, it is manifest that if the kingdom of Christ be indeed set up and maintained in the world it must be by supernatural power. Indeed, it is so even in the smallest detail. Every grain of true faith in this world is a divine creation, and every hour in which the true church subsists is a prolonged miracle. It is not the goodness of human nature, nor the force of reasoning, which exalts Christ, and builds up the church, but a power from above. This staggers the adversary, for he cannot understand what it is which baffles him: of the Holy Ghost he knows nothing. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;It </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>marvellous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eyes.&quot; </span>We actually see it; it is not in our thoughts and hopes and prayers alone, but the astonishing work is actually before our eyes. Jesus reigns, his power is felt, and we perceive that it is so. Faith sees our great Master, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; she sees and marvels. It never ceases to astonish us, as we see, even here below, God by means of weakness defeating power, by the simplicity of his word baffling the craft of men, and by the invisible influence of his Spirit exalting his Son in human hearts in the teeth of open and determined opposition. It is indeed &quot;marvellous in our eyes,&quot; as all God&#39;s works must be if men care to study them. In the Hebrew the passage reads, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;It </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wonderfully </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>done&#39;&#39;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span>not only is the exaltation of Jesus of Nazareth itself wonderful, but the way in which it is brought about is marvellous: it is wonderfully done. The more we study the history of Christ and his church the more fully shall we agree with this declaration.</p>

No doubt the Israelitish nation celebrated the victory of its champion with a day of feasting, music and song; and surely it is but meet that we should reverently keep the feast of the triumph of the Son of David. We observe the Lord&#39;s day as henceforth our true Sabbath, a day made and ordained of God, for the perpetual remembrance of the achievements of our Redeemer. Whenever the soft Sabbath light of the first day of the week breaks upon the earth, let us sing,</p>

Rather will we exhibit a double joy, rejoice in heart and be glad in face, rejoice in secret and be glad in public, for we have more than a double reason for being glad in the Lord. We ought to be specially joyous on the Sabbath : it is the queen of days, and its hours should be clad in royal apparel of delight. George Herbert says of it :&#8212;</p>

This was the peculiar shout of the feast of tabernacles; and so long as we dwell here below in these tabernacles of clay we cannot do better than use the same cry. Perpetually let us pray that our glorious King may work salvation in the midst of the earth. We plead also for ourselves that the Lord would save us, deliver us, and continue to sanctify us.

Our Lord Jesus himself pleads for the salvation and the prosperity of his chosen; as our Intercessor before the throne he asks that the heavenly Father would save and keep those who were of old committed to his charge, and cause them to be one through the indwelling Spirit. Salvation had been given, and therefore it is asked for. Strange though it may seem, he who cries for salvation is already in a measure saved. None can so truly cry, &quot;Save, I beseech thee,&quot; as those who have already participated in salvation; and the most prosperous church is that which most imploringly seeks prosperity. It may seem strange that, returning from victory, flushed with<a id='GBS.PA333.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.354.1.0.box.163.287.1304.391.q.60'>
triumph, the hero should still ask for salvation ; but so it is, and it could not be otherwise. When all our Saviour&#39;s work and warfare were ended, his intercession became even more prominently a feature of his life; after he had conquered all his foes he made intercession for the transgressors. What is true of him is true of his church also, for whenever she obtains the largest measure of spiritual blessing she is then most inclined to plead for more. She never pants so eagerly for prosperity as when she sees the Lord&#39;s doings in her midst, and marvels at them. Then, encouraged by the gracious visitation, she sets apart her solemn days of prayer, and cries with passionate desire, &quot; Save now,&quot; and &quot;Send now prosperity.&quot; She would fain take the tide at the flood, and make the most of the day of which the Lord has already made so much.</span></p>

We know who it is that cometh in the name of the Lord beyond all others. In the psalmist&#39;s days he was The Coming One, and he is still The Coming One, though he hath already come. We are ready with our hosannas both for his first and second advent; our inmost souls thankfully adore and bless him and invoke upon his head unspeakable joys. &quot;Prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall he be praised.&quot; For his sake everybody is blessed to us who comes in the name of the Lord, we welcome all such to our hearts and our homes; but chiefly, and beyond all others, we welcome <span style='font-style:italic;'>himself </span>when he deigns to enter in and sup with us and we with him.

All those whose high privilege it is to dwell in the house of the Lord for ever, because they are made priests unto God in Christ Jesus, can truly say that they bless the Christ who has made them what they are, and placed them where they are. Whenever we feel ourselves at home with God, and feel the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, &quot;Abba Father,&quot; the first thought of our hearts should be to bless the elder Brother, through whom the privilege of sonship has descended to such unworthy ones. In looking back upon our past lives we can remember many delightful occasions in which with joy unutterable we have in the fulness of our heart blessed our Saviour and our King; and all these memorable seasons are <span style='font-style:italic;'>t,o </span>many foretastes and pledges of the time when in the house of our great Father above wc shall for ever sing, &quot;Worthy is the Lamb that was slain,&quot; and with rapture bless the Redeemer&#39;s name.</p>

We have received light, by which we have known the rejected stone to be the head of the corner, and this light has led us to enlist beneath the banner of the once despised Nazarene, who is now the Prince of the kings of the earth. With the light of knowledge has come the light of joy; for we are delivered from the powers of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God&#39;s dear Son. Our knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ came not by the light of nature, nor by reason, nor did it arise from the sparks which we ourselves had kindled, nor did we receive it of men; but the mighty God alone hath showed it to us. He made a day on purpose that he might shine upon us like the sun, and he made our faces to shine in the light of that day, according to the declaration of the twenty-fourth verse.

The sacrifice which we would present in honour of the victories of our Lord Jesus Christ is the living sacrifice of our spirit, soul, and body. We bring ourselves to his altar, and desire to offer him all that we have and are. There remains a tendency in our nature to start aside from this; it is not fond of the sacrificial knife. In the warmth of our love we come willingly to the altar, but we need constraining power to keep us there in the entirety of our being throughout the whole of life. Happily there is a cord which, twisted around the atonement, or, better still, around the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our only Altar, can hold us, and does hold us: &quot;For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died ; and that he died for all, that they that live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.&quot; We are bound to the doctrine of atonement; we are bound to Christ himself, who is both altar and sacrifice; we desire to be more bound to him than ever, our soul finds her liberty in being tethered fast to the altar of the Lord. The American Board of Missions has for its seal an ox, with an altar on one side and a plough on the other, and the motto &quot; Ready for either,&quot;&#8212;ready to live and labour, or ready to suffer and die. We would gladly spend ourselves for the Lord actively, or be spent by him passively, whichever may be his will; but since we know the rebellion of our corrupt nature we earnestly pray that we may be kept in this consecrated mind, and that we may never, under discouragements, or through the temptations of the world, be permitted to leave the altar, to which it is our intense desire to be for ever fastened. Such consecration as this, and such desires for its perpetuity, well beseem that day of gladness which the Lord hath made so bright by the glorious triumph of his Son, our covenant head, our well-beloved.</p>

What better close could there be to this right royal song? The psalmist would have risen to something higher, so as to end with a climax, but nothing loftier remained. He had reached the height of his grandest argument, and there he paused.

It is a gathering together of all the Lord&#39;s people, to be witnesses and partakers of his glory. The flist, second, and third veisesof the 118th Psalm are sung by single voices. As the procession moves along, the theme of rejoicing is announced. The first voice repeats, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Ogive </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thanks </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>because </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span>ecer.&quot; Another single voice calls on Israel to acknowledge this great truth ; and a third invites the house of Aaron, the priesthood, to acknowledge their share in Jehovah&#39;s love. The fourth verse is a chorus; the whole procession, the living, and the dead who are raised to meet Christ (1 Thess. iv. 1G), shout aloud the burden of the song, verse 1. Arrived at the temple gate, or rather, the gate of Jerusalem, the Conqueror alone sings, verses 5, 6, 7. He begins by recounting the circumstances of his distress. Next, he tells of his refuge: I betook me to God, I told him my sorrows, and he heard me. The procession, in chorus, sings verses 8 and 9, taking up the substance of Messiah&#39;s chaunt, and fully echoing the sentiment, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;It </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>better </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trust </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>than </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>put </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>confidence </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>princes.&#39;&#39; </span>The Conqueror alone again sings verses 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. He enlaiges on the magnitude of his dangers, and the hopelessness of his situation. It was not a common difficulty, or a single enemy, whole nations compassed him about. The procession in chorus, verses 15, 16, attributes their Lord&#39;s gieat deliverance to his righteous person, and to his righteous cause. Justice and equity and tiuth, all demanded that Messiah should not be trodden down. &quot;Was it not thine arm, O Jehovah, which has gotten thee the victory?&quot; Messiah now takes up the language of a conqueror, verses 17, 18, 19. My sufferings were sore, but they were only for a season. I laid down my life, and I now take it up again: and then, with a loud voice, as when he roused Lazarus out of the grave, he cries to those within the walls, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Open </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gates </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteousness</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>go </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span>LoitD.&quot; The priests and Levites within instantly obey his command, and while they throw open the gates, they sing, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;This </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gate </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>which </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>righteous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>shnll </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enter.</span>&quot; As he enters, the Conqueror alone repeats verse 21. His sorrows are ended, his victory is complete. The objects for which be lived and died, and for which his prayers were offered, are now fulfilled, and thus, in a few short words, he expresses his joy and gratitude to God. The priests and Levites sing in chorus verses 22, 23, 24. Depositaries and expounders of the prophecies as they had long been, they now, for the first time, quote and apply one, Isai. xxviii. 16, which held a conspicuous place, but never before was intelligible to Jewish ears. &quot;The man of sorrows,&quot; the stone which the builders refused, is become the headstone of the corner. The Conqueror is now within the gates, and proceeds to accomplish his good purpose, Luke i. 68. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Hosannah, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>save </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>0 </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>send </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>now </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>prosperity,&quot; </span>verse 25. The priests and Levites are led by the Spirit to use the words foretold by our Lord, Matt, xxiii. 39. Now at length the veil is removed, and his people say, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Blessed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cometh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Loud,&quot; </span>verse 26. The Conqueror and his train (verse 27) now praise God, who has given light and deliverance and salvation, and they offer to him the sacrifice of thanksgiving for all that they enjoy. The Conqueror alone (verse 28) next makes a solemn acknowledgment of gratitude and praise to Jehovah, and then, all being within the gates, the united body, triumphant procession, priests and Levites, end, as they commenced, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;0 </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thanks </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>; <span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>good</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>: </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mercy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&#39;&#39;</span>&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>R. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>H. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ryland, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Psalms </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>restored </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Messiah,&#39;&#39; </span>1853.</p>
