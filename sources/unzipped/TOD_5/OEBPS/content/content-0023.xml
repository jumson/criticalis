Perhaps they assisted in necromantic rites which were intended to open a correspondence with departed spirits, thus endeavouring to break the seal of God&#39;s providence, and burst into the secret chambers which God has shut up. Those who are weary of seeking the living God have often shown a hankering after dark sciences, and have sought after fellowship with demons and spirits. To what strong delusions those are often given up who cast off the fear of God! This remark is as much needed now as in days gone by.</p>

This time the offences clamoured for judgment, and the judgment came at once. Twenty-four thousand persons fell before a sudden and deadly disease which threatened to run through the whole camp. Their new tins brought on them a disease new to their tribes. VVhen men invent sins God will not be slow to invent punishments. Their vices were a moral pest, and they were visited with a bodily pest: so the Lord meets like with its like.</p>

His righteous indignation moved him to a quick execution of two open offenders. His honest spirit could not endure that lewdness should be publicly practised at a time when a fast had been prociaimed. Such daring defiance of God and of all law he could not brook, and so with his sharp javelin he transfixed the two guilty ones in the very act. It was a holy passion which inflamed him, and no enmity to either of the persons whom he slew. The circumstances were so remarkable and the sin so flagrant that it would have involved great sin in a public man to have stood still and seen God thus defied, and Israel thus polluted. Phinehas was not of this mind, he was no trimmer, or palliator of sin, his heart was sound in God&#39;s statutes, and his whole nature was ablaze with zeil for God&#39;s glory, and therefore, though a priest, and therefore not obliged to be an executioner, he undertook the unwelcome task, and though both transgressors were of princely stock he had no respect of persons, but dealt justice upon them as if they had been the lowest of the people. This brave and decided deed was so acceptable to God as a proof that there wete some sincere souls in Israel that the deadly visitation went no further. Two deaths had sufficed to save the lives of the multitude.</p>

The scene changes, but the sin continues. Aforetime they had mutinied about water when prayer would soon have turned the desert into a standing pool, but now they do it again after their former experience of the divine goodness.

After foity years bearing with them the meek man&#39;s temper gave way, and he called them rebels, and showed unhallowed anger; and therefore he was not permitted to enter the land which he desired to inherit. Truly, he had a sight of the goodly country from the top of Pisgah, but entrance was denied him, and thus it went ill with him. It was <span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span>sin which angered him, but <span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span>had to bear the consequences; however clear it may be that others are more guilty than ourselves, we should always remember that this will not screen <span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span>but every man must bear his own burden.</p>

He did not speak blasphemously, or falsely, but only hastily and w-ithout care; but this is a serious fault in a lawgiver, and especially in one who speaks for God. This passage is to our mind one of the most terrible in the Bible. Truly we serve a jealous God. Yet he is not a haid master, or austere; we must not think so. but we must the rather be jealous of ourselves, and watch that we live the more carefully, and speak the more advisedly, because we serve such a Lord. We ought also to be very careful how we treat the ministers of the gospel, lest by provoking their spirit we should drive them into any unseemly behaviour which should bring upon them the chastisement of the Lord. Little do a murmuring, quarrelsome people dream of the perils in which they involve their pastors by their untoward behaviour.</p>

It is a great evil with professors that they are not zealous for the total destruction of all sin within and without. We make alliances of peace where we ought to proclaim war to the knife; we plead our constitutional temperament, our previous habits, the necessity of our circumstances, or some other evil excuse as an apology for being content with a very partial sanctitication, if indeed it be sanctification at all. We are slow also to rebuke sin in others, and are ready to spare respectable sins, which like Agag walk with mincing steps. The measure of our destruction of sin is not to be our inclination, or the habit of others, but the Lord&#39;s command. We have no warrant for dealing leniently with any sin, be it what it may.</p>

Having enough faults of their own, they were yet ready to go to school to the filthy Canaanites, and educate themselves still more in the arts of iniquity. It was certain that they could learn no good from men whom the Lord had condemned to utter destruction. Few would wish to go to the condemned cell for learning, yet Israel sat at the feet of accursed Canaan and rose up proficient in every abomination. This, too, is a grievous but common error among professors: they court worldly company and copy worldly fashions, and yet it is their calling to bear witness against these things.

As a husband is deeply dishonoured and sorely wounded should Ins wife become unchaste and run riot with many paramours in his own house, so was the Lord incensed at his people for setting up gods many and lords many in his own land. They made and invented new gods, and then worshipped what they had made. What a folly! Their novel deities were loathsome monsters and cruel demons, and yet they paid them homage. What wickedness! And to commit this folly and wickedness they cast off the true God, whose mirafles they had seen, and whose people they were. This was provocation of the severest sort.</p>

Whenever God so blesses his own people that his goodness is perceived by carnal sense, in bestowing riches, honours, peace, health and things of that kind, then it is easy to acknowledge that God is good, and that acknowledgment can be made by the most carnal men. The case stands otherwise when he visits offenders with the rod of correction and scourges them with the grace of chastisement. Then the flesh hardly bears to confess what by its own sense it does not perceive. It fails to discern the goodness of God unto salvation in the severity of the rod<a id='GBS.PA87.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.108.1.0.box.161.329.1299.319.q.60'>
Bnd the scourging, and therefore refuses to acknowledge that goodness in strokes and suffeiings. The prophet, however, throughout this Psalm celebrates in many instances the way wherein the sinning people were arrested and smitten. And when he proposed that this Psalm should be sung in the church of God, Israel was under the cross and afflictions. Yet he demands that Itrael chould acknowledge that the Lord is good. that&#187;his mercy endureth for evereven in the act of smiting the offender. That therefore alone is a true and full confession of the divine goodness which is made not only in prusperity but also in adversity.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Museulus. </span></span></p>

See 1 Chron. xvi. 34&#8212;36. Hence it has been ascribed to the pen of David. Many of the ancients thought, and they are followed by Horsley and Mudge, that it was written during the captivity; restins: their opinion chiefly on verse 47 ; but as that verse occuis m the Psulm of David recorded in 1 Chron. xvi., at the 35th verse, this argument is cleaily without force.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Anderson&#39;</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Note </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>loe. </span></p>

Not that he exalts the power of God designedly to deter us from celebrating its piaises, but rather as the menus of stirring us up to do so to the utmost of our power. Is it any reason for ceasing our exertions, that with whatever alacrity we pursue our course, we yet come far short of perfection? But the thing which ought to inspiie us with the greatest encouragement is the knowledge that, though ability may fail us, the praises which from the heart wo offer to God are pleasing to him; only let us beware of callousness; for it would certainly be very absurd for those who cannot attain to a tithe of perfection, to make that the occasion of their not reaching to the hundredth part of it.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>

Without a full confession of mercies it is not possible to make either a due valuation of them, or a just requital of them.

The Israelites could not sin against God, after those miracles in Egypt, without a signal provocation of that power that they had so late, and so convincing an experience of: a power that could have crushed an Israelite as easily as an Egyptian ; and given as teirible an instance of its consuming force upon false friends, as upon professed enemies; in the sight of God, perhaps, the less sort of offenders of the two.</p>

But now patience is a further and an higher advance of mercy; it is mercy drawn out at length; mercy wrestling with baseness, and striving, if possible, even to weary and outdo ingratitude; and therefore a sin against this is the highest pitch, the utmost improvement, and, as I may so speak, the <span style='font-style:italic;'>Tie </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>plus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ultra </span>of provocation.

The chapter which contains the poition of their history here alluded to, begins with rapturous expressions of gratitude, and ends with the murmurs of discontent ; both uttered by the same lips, within the short space of three days. Their expressions of gratitude were called forth by that wonderful display&#39;of the divine perfections, which delivered them from the host of Pharaoh, and destroyed their enemies. Their murmurs were excited by a comparatively trifling inconvenience, which in a few hours was removed.

Their conduct, as heie described, affords a striking exemplification of that spurious gratitude, which often bursts forth in a sudden flash, when dreaded evils are averted, or unexpected favours bestowed; but expires with the occasion that gave it birth; a gratitude resembling the joy excited in an infant&#39;s breast by the gift of some glittering toy. which is received with rapture, and pleases for an hour; but when the charm of novelty vanishes, is thrown aside with indifference; and the hand that bestowed it is forgotten. Springing from no higher principle than gratified self-love, it is neither acceptable to God, nor productive of obedience to his laws; nor does it in any respect really resemble that holy, heaveu-boin affection, whose language it often borrows, and whose name it assumes. It may be called, distinctively, the gratitude of sinners; who, as they love those that love them, will of course be grateful to those that are kind to them; giateful even to God when they view him as kind.</p>

They should grow twice as fast, bring forth twice as fast, bring forth twice as many lambs, twice as much wool, twice as much milk, as those that go upon bare commons. All the world may cry shame on such a man that is high fed, and often fed with fat and sweet ordinances, if he be still like Pharaoh&#39;s lean kine, as lean and ill-favoured as ever he was before. Certainly, fat ordinances and lean souls do not well agree. We are to look upon it as the greatest of judgments to have <span style='font-style:italic;'>leanness </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sent </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>souls </span>while we are fed with <span style='font-style:italic;'>manna. </span>We look on it as an affliction to have an over-lean body; but it&#39;s a far sadder condition to have a lean soul. Of the two, it were far better to have a well-thriving body and a lean soul : it is a great mercy when both prosper, 3 John 2: &quot;I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.&quot; Oh it is a sweet thing, especially to have a prospering soul, and still upon the growing hand : and God expects it should be so, where he affords good diet, great means of grace; as Dan. i. 10: &quot;The prince of the eunuchs said unto D.iniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink.&quot; If you should look ill, who fare so well, I should be sure to bear the blame; it were so much as my head is worth. So certainly, where God affords precious food for precious souls, if these souls be lean under fat ordinances, either those that are fed, or those that feed them; either the stewards or the household ; either minister, or people, or both, are sure to bear the blame. It is but equal and just that such should grow.

O noble and heroical courage of Phinehas! which, as it was rewarded of God, so is worthy to be admired of men. He doth not stand casting of scruples: Who am I to do this? The son of the high priest. My place is all for peace and mercy : it is for me to sacrifice, aud pray for the sin of the people, not to sacrifice any of the people for their sin.

Is not the one a great prince in Israel, the other a princess of Midian? Can the death of two so famous personages go unrevenged? Or, if it be safe and fit, why doth my uncle Moses rather shed his own tears than their blood? I will mourn with the rest; let them revenge whom it concerneth.

How careful preachers of the gospel and expounders of Scripture should be not to give an erroneous impression of God&#39;s mind or message. The mental acumen is rare, but the right spirit is rarer. But what is the right spirit ?&#8212; A loving spirit, a gentle spirit, a faith firl spirit, a meek and weaned spirit, a spirit which says, &quot;Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth,&quot; and a spirit which adds, &quot;All that the Lord giveth me, that will I speak,&quot; that excellent spirit which is only imparted by the good Spirit of God. For if He withdraw, even a Moses ceases to be meek, and ceasing to be meek, even a Moses becomes a bad divine and an erroneous teacher, striking the rock that has been already stricken once for all, and preaching glad tidings gruffly. He who gives the living water does not grudge it; but sometimes, instead of &quot;Ho! every one that thirsteth,&quot; the preacher says, &quot; Hear now, ye rebels : must we fetch you water out of this rock?&quot; and makes the very invitation repulsive.</p>

When any one has run long and run well, how sad it is to stumble within a few steps of the goal! If Moses had an earthly wish, it was to see Israel safe in their inheritance, and his wish was all but consummated. Faith and patience had held out well nigh forty years, and in a few months more the Jordan would be crossed and the work would be finished. And who can tell but this very nearness of the prize helped to create something of a presumptuous confidence? The blood of Moses was hot to begin with, and he was not the meekest of men when he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. But he had got a good lesson in ruling his spirit, and betwixt the long sojourn with Jethro and the self-discipline needful in the charge of this multitude, he might fancy that he had now his foot on the neck of this enemy : when lo ! the sin revives and Moses dies.</p>

Elevation of mind and sweetness of spirit aie pearls of great price, and if we wish to preserve them we had better iutiust them to God&#39;s own keeping. If Moses lost his faith, it was by first losing self-command : and if a man lose this, it is hard to say what next he may lose: like the mad warrior who makes a missile of his shield and hulls it at the head of an enemy, he is henceforward open to every fiery dart, to the cut and thrust of every assailant.

When the oracle of Apollo was asked by the Athenians how they might make amends for their killing of Androgeus, it willed them to send yearly to king Minos seven bodies of each sex to appease the wrath of god. Now this kind of yearly sacrifice continued still in Athens in the time of Socrates. Thus the Carthaginians, being vanquished by Agathocles, king of Sicily, and supposing their god to be displeased, to appease him did sacrifice two hundrtd noble men&#39;s children. This custom was ancient even before the Trojan war, for then was Iphigenia sacrificed. Thus we read that the Latins sacrificed the tenth of their children to Jupiter; that men and children were usually sacrificed to Saturn in many places in Candia, Rhodomene, Phoenice, Africa, and those commonly the choice and dearest of their children and most nobly descended. The manner of sacrificing their children to Saturn, Diodorus relates to be this: bringing their children to the statue or image of Saturn, which was&#39; of huge gteatness, they gave them into his hands, which were made so hollow and winding that the children offered slipped and fell down through into a cave and furnace of fire. These sacrifices continued in use till the birth and death of our Saviour Christ, who came to destroy the work of the devil; for such sacrifices were first forbidden by Augustus Caesar; after more generally by Tiberius (in whose reign our Saviour suffered) who, as Tertullian writes, so straitly forbade them, that he crucified the priests who offered them: howbeit, even in Tertulliau&#39;s time, and after in Eusebius&#39; and Lactantius&#39; times, such sacrifices were offered (but closely) to Jupiter LatiaHs.</p>

Cod commands no such thing, but forbids it, and threatens plagues to his people, because they had forsaken him and &quot;built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for buint offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, not spake it, neither came it into my mind &quot; (Jcr. xix. 5). Most infallibly then we may conclude that none but Satan, that aich-devil, with his angels, were the commanders of such service, for this agrees right well with his nature, who hath been a muiderer from the beginning.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>liobrrt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Jenison, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;The, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Height </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Israel&#39;s </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Heathenish </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Idolatrie, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ikwrificing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>their </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Children </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Devill,&quot; </span>1621.</p>

For by how much the Jews were under the influence of burning zeal, by so much docs the prophet convict them of being guilty of greater wickedness; because their madness carried them away to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that they did not spare even their own offspring. Were good intentions meritorious, as idolaters suppose, then indeed the laying aside of all natural affection in sacrificing thtir own children was a deed deserving the highest praise. But when men at&#39;t under the impulse of their own capricious humour, the more they occupy themselves with acts of external worship, the more do they increase their guilt. For what difference was there between Abraham and those persons of whom the prophet makes mention, but that the former, under the influence of faith, was ready to offer up his son, while the latter, carried away by the impulse of intemperate zeal, cast off all natural affection, and imbrued their hands in the blood of their own offspring.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>John </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Calvin. </span></p>
