What wonderful intercourse there has been between the Father and the Son! From this secret and. intimate communion springs the covenant of grace and all its marvellous arrangements. All the great acts of grace are brought into actual being by the word of God ; had he not spoken, there had been no manifestation of Deity to us; but in the beginning was the Word, and from of old there was mysterious fellowship between the Father and his Son Jesus Christ concerning his people and the great contest on their behalf between himself and the powers of evil. How condescending on Jehovah&#39;s part to permit a mortal ear to hear, and a human pen to record his secret converse with his co-equal Son! How greatly should we prize the revelation of his private and solemn discourse with the Son, herein made public for the refreshing of his people!

was an anticipation of the exclamation of Thomas, &quot;My Lord and my God,&quot; and it expresses the Psalmist&#39;s reverence, his obedience, his believing appropiiation, and his joy in Christ.

His work is done, and he may sit; it is well done, and he may sit at his right hand ; it will have grand results, and he may therefore quietly wait to see the complete victory which is certain to follow. The glorious Jehovah thus addresses the Christ as our Saviour; for, says David, he said &quot; unto my Lord.&quot; Jesus is placed in the seat of power, dominion, and dignity, and is to sit there by divine appointment while Jehovah fights for him, and lays every rebel beneath his feet. He sits there by the Father&#39;s ordinance and call, and will sit there despite all the raging of his adversaries, till they are all brought to utter shame by his putting his foot upon their necks. In this sitting he is our representative. The mediatorial kingdom will last until the last enemy shall be destroyed, and then, according to the inspired word, &quot;cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father.&quot; The work of subduing the nations is now in the hand of the great God, who by his Providence will accomplish it to the glory of his Son; his woid is pledged to it, and the session of his Son at his right hand is the guarantee thereof; therefore let us never fear as to the future. While we see our Lord and representative sitting in quiet expectancy, we, too, may sit in the attitude of peaceful assuiance, and with confidence await the grand outcome of all events. As surely as Jehovah liveth Jesus must reign, yea, even now he is reigning, though all his enemies are not yet subdued. During the present interval, through which we wait for his glorious appearing and visible millennial kingdom, he is in the place of power, and his dominion is in no jeopardy, or otherwise he would not remain quiescent. He sits because all is safe, and he sits at Jehovah&#39;s right hand because omnipotence waits to accomplish his will. Therefore there is no cause for alarm whatever may happen in this lower world; the sight of Jesus enthroned in divine glory is the sure guarantee that all things are moving onward towards ultimate victory. Those rebels who now stand high in power shall soon be in the place of contempt, they shall be his footstool. He shall with ease rule them, he shall sit and put his foot on them; not rising to tread them down as when a man puts forth force to subdue powerful foes, but retaining the attitude of rest, and still ruling them as abject vassals who have no longer spirit to rebel, but have become thoroughly tamed and subdued.</p>

We have need to pray for the sending out of the rod of divine strength. It was by his rod that Moses smote the Egyptians, and wrought wonders for Israel, and even so whenever the Lord Jesus sends forth the rod of his strength, our spiritual enemies are overcome. There may be an allusion here to Aaron&#39;s rod which budded and so proved his power; this was laid up in the ark, but our Lord&#39;s rod is sent forth to subdue his foes. This promise began to be fulfilled at Pentecost, and it continues even to this day, and shall yet have a grander fulfilment. O God of eternal might, let the strength of our Lord Jesus be more clearly seen, and let the nations see it as coming forth out of the midst of thy feeble people, even from Zion, the place of thine abode. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Rule </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>midst </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thine </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>enemies;&quot; </span>as he does whenever his mighty sceptre of grace is stretched forth to renew and save them.

out of the flinty rock, and the gospel of Jesus soon causes repentance to flow in rivers from the once hardened heart of man. Or the text may mean that though the church is situated in the midst of a hostile world, yet it exerts a great influence, it continues to manifest an inward majesty, and is after all the ruling power among the nations because the shout of a king is in her midst. Jesu.<sup>a</sup>, however hated by men, is still the King of kings. His luleis over even the most unwilling, so as to overrule their fiercest opposition to the advancement of his cause. Jesus, it appears from this text, is not inactive duiing his session at Jehovah&#39;s right hand, but in his own way proves the abiding nature of his kingdom both <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>Zion and <span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span>Zion, both among his friends ai d his foes. We look for the clearer manifestation of his almighty power in the lntter days; but even in these wuiting times we rejoice that to the Lord all power is given in heaven and in earth.</span></p>

Given to him of old, they are his people, and when his power is revealed, those hasten with cheerfulness to own his sway, appearing at the gospel call as it were spontaneously, even as the dew comes forth in the morning. This metaphor is fuither enlarged upon, for as the dew has a sparkling beauty, so these willing armies of eonveits have a holy excellence and chaim about them ; and as the dew is the lively emblem of freshness, so are these converts full of vivacity and youthful vigour, and the church is refreshed by them and made to flourish exceedingly. Let but the gospel be preached with divine unclion, and the chosen of the Lord respond to it like troops in the day of the mustering of armies; they come arrayed by grace in shining unifoinis of holiness, and for number, freshness, beauty, and purity, they are as the dewdrops which come mysteriously from the morning&#39;s womb. Some refer this passage to the resurrection, but even if it be so. the work of grace in regeneration is equally well described by it, for it is a spiritual resurrection. Even as the holy dead rise gladly into the lovely image of their Lord, so do quickened souls put on the glorious righteousness of Christ, and stand forth to behold their Lord and serve him. How truly beautiful is holiness! God h inself admires it. How wonderful also is the eternal youth of the mystical body of Christ! As the dew is new every morning, so is there a constant succession of conveits to give to the church perpetual juvenility. Her young men have a dew from the Lord upon them, and arouse in her armies an undying enthusiasm for him whose &quot; locks are bushy and black as a raven&quot; with unfailing youth. Since Jesus ever lives, so shall his church ever flourish. As his strength never faileth, so shall the vigour of his true people be renewed day by day. As he is a Priest-King, so are his people all priests and kings, and the beauties of holiness are their priestly dress, their garments for glory and for beauty; of these priests unto God there shall be an unbroken succession. The realization of this day of power during the time of the Lord&#39;s tarrying is that which we should constantly pray for; and we may legitimately expect it since he ever sits in the seat of honour and power, and puts forth his strength, according to his own word, &quot;My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.&quot;</p>

It is the Lord who has constituted him a priest for ever, he has done it by oath, that oath is without repentance, is taking effect now, and will stand thioughout all ages: hence our security in him is placed beyond all question.</span></p>

The order of Melchizedek&#39;s priesthood was the most ancient and primitive, the most free from ritual and ceremony, the most natural and simple, and at the same time the most honourable. That ancient patriaeh was the father of his people, and at the same time ruled and taught them; he swayed both the sceptre and the censer, reigned in righteousness, and offered sacrifice before the Lord. There has never arisen another like to him since his days, for whenever the kings of Judah attempted to seize the sacerdotal office they were driven back to their confusion: God would have no king-priest save his son. Melchizedek&#39;s office was exceptional: none preceded or succeeded him; he comes upon the page of history mysteriously; no pedigree is given, <span style='font-style:italic;'>uo </span>date of birth, or mention of death ; he blesses Abraham, receives tithe and vanishes from the scene amid honours which show that he was greater than the founder of the chosen nation. He is seen but once, and that once suffices. Aaron and his seed came and went; their imperfect saciifice continued for many generations, because it had no finality in it, and could never m ike the comers thereunto perfect. Our Lord Jesus, like Melchizedek, stands forth before us as a priest of divine ordaining; not made a priest by fleshly birth, as the sons of Aaron ; he mentions neither father, mother, nor descent, as his right to the sacred office; he stands upon his personal merits, by himself alone; as no man came before him in his vvoik, so none can follow after; his order begins and ends in his own person, and in himself it is eternal, &quot;having neither beginning of days nor end of yeais.&quot; The King-Priest has been here and left his blessing upon the believing seed, and now he sits in glory in his complete character, atoning for us by the met it of his blood, and exercising all power on our behalf.</p>

Yet should kings oppose the Lord with weapons of war, the result would be their overwhelming defeat and the entire destruction of their forces.

O King-priest, we who are, in a minor degree, king-priests too, are full of gladness because thou reignest even now, and wilt come ere long to vindicate thy cause and establish thine empire for ever. Even so, come quickly. Amen.</p>
