True praise begins at home. It is idle to stir up others to praise if we are ungratefully silent ourselves. We should call upon our inmost hearts to awake and bestir themselves, for we are apt to be sluggish, and if we are so when called upon to bless God, we shall have great cause to be ashamed. &quot;When we magnify the Lord, let us do it heartily: our best is far beneath his worthiness, let us not dishonour him by rendering to him half-hearted worship. &quot;0 <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>very </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>great.&quot; </span>This ascription has in it a remarkable blending of the boldness of faith, and the awe of holy fear: for the psalmist calls the infinite Jehovah <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God,&quot; </span>and at the same time, prostrate in amazement at the divine greatmss, he cries out in utter astonishment, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>very </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>great.&quot; </span>God was great on Sinai, yet the opening words of his law were, &quot;I am the Lord thy God ;&quot; his greatness is no reason why faith should not put in her claim, and call him all her own. The declaration of Jehovah&#39;s greatness here given would have been very much in place at the end of the psalm, for it is a natural inference and deduction from a survey of the universe: its position at the very commencement of the poem is an indication that the whole psalm was well considered and digested in the mind befoie it was actually put into words; only on this supposition can we account for the emotion preceding the contemplation. Observe also, that the wonder expressed does not refer to the creation and its greatness, but to Jehovah himself. It is not &quot; the universe is very great !&quot; but &quot; Tnoti art very great.&quot; Many stay at the creature, and so become idolatrous in spirit; to pass onward to the Creator himself is true w-isdom. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Thou </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>art </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>clothed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>/umour </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>majesty.&quot; </span>Thou thyself art not to be seen, but thy works, which may be called thy garments, are full of beauties and marvels which redound to thine honour. Garments both conceal and reveal a man, and so do the creatures of God. The Lord is sven in his works as worthy of <span style='font-style:italic;'>honour </span>for his skill, his goodness, and his power, and as claiming <span style='font-style:italic;'>majesty, </span>for he has fashioned all things in sovereignty, doing as he wills, and asking no man&#39;s permit. He must be blind indeed who does not see that nature is the work of a king. These aie solemn strokes of God&#39;s severer mind, terrible touches of his sterner attributes, bioad lines of inscrutable mystery, and deep shadings of overwhelming power, and these make creation&#39;s picture a problem never to be solved, except by admitting that he who drew it giveth no account of his matters, but ruleth all things according to the good pleasure of his will. His <span style='font-style:italic;'>majesty </span>is, however, always so displayed as to reflect <span style='font-style:italic;'>honour </span>upon his whole character; he does as he wills, but he wills only that which is thrice holy, like himself. The very robes of the unseen Spirit teach us this, and it is ours to recognize it with humble adoration.</p>

We are lost in astonishment, and dare not pry into the mystery lest we be blinded by its insufferable glory. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>stretehest </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heavens </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>like </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>curtain&quot;</span>&#8212;within which he might dwell. Light was created on the first day and the firmament upon the second, so that they fitly follow each other in this verse. Oriental piinces put on their glorious apparel and then sit in state within curtains, and the Lord is spoken of under that image : but how far above all comprehension the figure must be lifted, since the robe is essential light, to which suns and moons owe their brightness, and the curtain is the azure sky studded with stars for gems. This is a substantial argument for the truth with which the psalmist commenced his song, &quot;O Lord my God, thou ait very great.&quot;</p>

wherein he resides, are based upon the floods which form the upper ocean. To the unsubstantial he lends stability; he needs no joists and rafters, for his palace is sustained by his own power. We are not to interpret literally where the language is poetical, it would be simple absurdity to do so. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>maketh </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>clouds </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>chariot.&#39;&#39; </span>When he comes forth from his secret pavilion &#39;tis thus he makes his royal progress. &quot;His chariot of wrath deep thunder-clouds form,&quot; and his chariot of mercy drops plenty as it traverses the celestial road. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Who </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>walketh </span>[or rather <span style='font-style:italic;'>goes] </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wind.&quot; </span>With the clouds for a car, and the winds for winged steeds, the Great King hastens on his movements whether for mercy or for judgment. Thus we have the idea of a king still fuither elaborated &#8212;his lofty palace, his chariot, and his coursers are before us; but what a palace must we imagine, whose beams are of crystal, and whose base is consolidated vapour! What a stately car is that which is fashioned out of the flying clouds, whose gorgeous colours Solomon in all his glory could not rival ; and what a Godlike progress is that in which spirit wings and breath of winds bear up the moving throne. &quot;O Lord, my God, thou art very great!&quot;</span></p>

Angels are pure spirits, though they are permitted to assume a visible form when God desires us to sec them. God is a spirit, and he is waited upon by spirits in his royal courts. Angels are like winds for mystery, force, and invisibility, and no doubt the winds themselves are often the angels or messengers of God. God who makes his angels to be as winds, can also make winds to be his angels, and they are constantly so in the economy of nature. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;His </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ministers </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>flaming </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>fire.&quot; </span>Here, too, we may choose which we will of two meanings: God&#39;s ministers or servants he makes to be as swift, potent, and terrible as fire, and on the other hand he makes fire, that devcuiing element, to be his minister flaming forth upon his errands. That the passage refers to angels is clear from Heb. i. 7 ; and it was most proper to mention them here in connection with light and the heavens, and immediately after the robes and palace of the Great King. Should not the retinue of the Lord of Hosts be mentioned as well as his chariot<span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;( </span>It would have been a flaw in the description of the universe had the angels not been alluded to, and this is the most appropriate place for their introduction. When we think of the extraordinary powers entrusted to angelic beings, and the mysterious glory of the seraphim and the four living creatures, we are led to reflect upon the glory of the Master whom they serve, and again we cry out with the psalmist, &quot;O Lord, my God, thou art very great.&quot;</p>

Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened, and who laid the corner stone thereof?&quot; And the words are found in the same connection too, for the Lord proceeds to say, &quot;When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>it </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>should </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>be </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>removed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>The language is, of course, poetical, but the fact is none the less wonderful : the earth is so placed in space that it remains as stable as if it were a fixture. The several motions of our planet are carried on so noiselessly and evenly that, as far as we are concerned, all things are as permanent and peaceful as if the old notion of its resting upon pillars were literally true. With what delicacy has the great Artificer poised our globe! What power must there be in that hand which has caused so vast a body to know its orbit, and to move so smoothly in it! W<sup>r</sup>hat engineer can save every part of his machinery from an occasional jar, jerk, or friction? yet to our great world in its complicated motions no such thing has ever occurred. &quot;O Lord, my God, thou art very great.&quot;</p>

The deluge was caused by the suspension of the divine mandate which held the floods in check : they knew their old supremacy, and hastened to reassert it, but now the covenant promise for ever prevents a return of that carnival of waters, that revolt of the waves: ought we not rather to call it that impetuous rush of the indignant floods to avenge the injured honour of their King, whom men had offended? Jehovah&#39;s word bounds the ocean, using only a narrow belt of sand to confine it to its own limits: that apparently feeble restraint answers every purpose, for the sea is obedient as a little child to the bidding of its Maker. Destruction lies asleep in the bed of the ocean, and though our sins might well arouse it, yet are its bands made strong by covenant mercy, so that it cannot break loose again upon the guilty sons of men.</p>

They are only asses, and wild, yet our heavenly Father careth for them. Will he not also care for us? We see here, also, that nothing is made in vain ; though no human lip is moistened by the brooklet in the lone valley, yet are there other creatures which need refreshment, and these slake their thirst at the stream. Is this nothing? Must everything exist for man, or else be wasted? What but our pride and selfishness could have suggested such a notion? It is not true that flowers which blush unseen by human eye are wasting their sweetness, for the bee finds them out, and other winged wanderers live on their luscious juices. Man is but one creature of the many whom the heavenly Father feedeth and watereth.</p>

Observe, also, how everything has its use&#8212;the boughs furnish a home for the birds; and every living thing has its accommodation&#8212;the stork finds a house in the pines. Her nest is called a bouse, because this bird exhibits domestic virtues and maternal love which make her young to be comparable to a family. No doubt this ancient writer had seen storks&#39; nests in fir trees; they appear usually to build on houses and ruins, but there is also evidence that where there are forests they are content with pine trees. Has the reader ever walked through a forest of great trees and felt the awe which strikes the heart in nature&#39;s sublime cathedral? Then he will remember to have felt that each bird was holy, since it dwelt amid such sacred solitude. Those who cannot see or hear of God except in Gothic edifices, amid the swell of organs, and the voices of a surpliced choir, will not be able to enter into the feeling which makes the simple, unsophisticated soul hear &quot; the voice of the Lord God walking among the trees.&quot;</p>

The appointed rule of the great lights is now the theme for praise. The moon is mentioned first, because in the Jewish day the night leads the way. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;He </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ajtpointed </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tlie </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>seasons.&quot; </span>By the waxing and waning of the moon the year is divided into months, and weeks, and by this means the exact dates of the holy days were arranged. Thus the lamp of night is made to be of service to man, and in fixing the period of religious assemblies (as it did among the Jews) it enters into connection with his noblest being. Never let us regard the moon&#39;s motions as the inevitable result of inanimate impersonal law, but as the appointment of our God. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sun </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>knoweih </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hix </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>going </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>down.&quot; </span>In finely poetic imagery the sun is represented as knowing when to retire from sight, and sink below the horizon. He never loiters on his way, or pauses as if undecided when to descend ; his appointed hour for going down, although it is constantly varying, he always keeps to a second. <span style='font-style:italic;'>We </span>need to be aroused in the morning, but he arises punctually, and though some require to watch the clock to know the hour of rest, he, without a timepiece to consult, hides himself in the western sky the instant the set time has come. For all this man should praise the Lord of the sun and moon, who has made these great lights to be our chronometers, and thus keeps our world in order, and suffers no confusion to distract us.</p>

Were there no darkness we should sigh for it, since we should find repose so much more difficult, if the weary day were never calmed into night.

Why should not the wild beast have his hour as well as man? He has a service to perfoim, should he not also have his food? Darkness is fitter for beasts than man; and those men are most brutish who love darkness rather than light. When the darkness of ignorance broods over a nation, then all soits of superstitions, cruelties, and vices abound ; the gospel, like the sumising, soon clears the world of the open ravages of these monsters, and they seek more congenial abodes. We see here the value of true light, for we may depend upon it where there is night there will also be wild beasts to kill and to devour.</p>

To whom do the lions roar? Certainly not to their prey, for the terrible sound tends to alarm their victims, and drive them away. They after their own fashion express their desires for food, and the expression of desire is a kind of prayer. Out of this fact comes the devout thought of the wild beast&#39;s appealing to its Maker for food. But neither with lions nor men will the seeking of prayer suffice, there must be practical seeking too, and the lions are well aware of it. What they have in their own language asked for they go forth to seek; being in this thing far wiser than many men who offer formal prayers not half so earnest as those of the young lions, and then neglect the means in the use of which the object of their petitions might be gained. The lions roar and seek; too many are liars before God, and roar but never seek.</p>

There was one who in this respect was poorer than lions and foxes, for he had not where to lay his head : all were provided for except their incarnate provider. Blessed Lord, thou hast stooped beneath the conditions of the brutes to lift up worse than brutish men!</span></p>

At nightfall they separate and go forth each one upon the merciful errand of ending the miseries of the sickly and decrepit among grass-eating animals. The younger of these animals being swift of foot easily escape them and are benefited by the exercise, and for the most part only those are overtaken and killed to whom life would have been protracted agony. 80 far lions are messengers of mercy, and are as much sent of God as the sporting dog is sent by man on his errands. But these mighty hunters must not always be abroad, they must be sent back to their lairs when man comes upon the scene. Who shall gather these ferocious creatures and shut them in? Who shall chain them down and make them harmless? The sun suffices to do it. He is the true lion-tamer. They gather themselves together as though they were so many sheep, and in their own retreats they keep themselves prisoners till returning darkness gives them another leave to range. By simply majestic means the divine purposes are accomplished. In like manner even the devils are subject unto our Lord Jesus, and by the simple spread of the light of the gospel these roaring demons are chased out of the world. No need for miracles or displays of physical power, the Sun of Righteousness arises, and the devil and the false gods, and superstitions and errors of men, all seek their hiding places in the dark places of the earth among the moles and the bats.</p>

If labour lasts out the average daylight it is certainly all that any man ought to expect of another, and yet there are poor creatures so badly paid that in twelve hours they cannot earn bread enough to keep them from hunger. Shame on those who dare so impose upon helpless women and children. Night work should also be avoided as much as possible.

It is more soft and hushed, but it is none the less true. The moon lights up a solemn silence of worship among the fir trees, through which the night wind softly breathes its &quot;songs without words.&quot; Every now and then a sound is heard, which, however simple by day, sounds among the shadows startling and weird-like, as if the presence of the unknown had filled the heart with trembling, and made the influence of the Infinite to be realized. Imagination awakens herself; unbelief finds the silence and the solemnity uncongenial, faith looks up to the skies above her and sees heavenly things all the more clearly in the absence of the sunlight, and adoration bows itself before the Great Invisible!

God is the great worker, and ordainer of variety. It is ours to study his works, for they are great, and sought out of all them that hsve pleasure therein.

They are wisely made&#8212;each one fits its place, fills it, and is happy in so doing. As a whole, the &quot;all&quot; of creation is a wise achievement, and however it may be chequered with mysteries, and clouded with terrois, it all woiks together for good, and as one complete harmonious piece of workmanship it answers the great Worker&#39;s end. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>earth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>full </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>riches.&quot; </span>It is not a poor-house, but a palace; not a hungry ruin, but a well-filled store-house.

The sea in many regions appears to be all alive, as if every drop were a world. Nor are these tiny creatures the only tenants of the sea, for it contains gigantic mammals which exceed in bulk those which range the land, and a vast host of huge fishes which wander among the waves, and hide in the caverns of the sea as the tiger lurks in the jungle, or the lion roams the plain. Truly, O Lord, thou makest the sea to be as rich in the works of thy hands as the land itself.</span></p>

It is because the entire bulk of the earth, atmosphere, uud clouds, participate in the movement. This constant velocity, with which all bodies situated on the surface of the earth are animated, would be the cause of the most terrible and general catastrophe that could be imagined, if, by uny possibility, the rotation of the earth were abruptly to cease. Such an event would be the precursor of a most sweeping destruction of all organized beings. But the constancy of the laws of nature peimits us to contemplate such n catastrophe without fear. It is demonstrated that the position of the poles of rotation on the surface of the earth is invariable. It has also been asked whether the velocity of the earth&#39;s rotation has changed, or, which comes to the same thing, if the length of the sidereal day and that of the solar day deduced from it have varied within the historical period? Laplace has replied to this question, and his demonstration shows that it has not varied the one hundredth of a second during the last two thousand years.&quot;</p>

Some great princes, heated with rage and drunken with pride, have cast shackles into the sea, as threatening it with imprisonment and bondage if it would not be quiet; but the sea would not be bound by them; they have also awarded so many strokes to be given the sea as a punishment of its contumacy and rebellion against either their commands or their designs. How ridiculously ambitious have they been, who would needs pretend to such a dominion! Many princes have had great power at and upon the sea, but there was never any prince had any power over the sea; that&#39;s a flower belonging to no crown but the crown of heaven.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Joseph </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Caryl. </span></span></p>

Large thorn bushes and forest shrubs dotted the plain on every side. In some places the ground was carpeted with flowers, and every bush seemed vocal with the cheerful twittering of birds.

Other trarellers have been more fortunate. Bonar speaks of the note of the cuckoo; Dr. Robinson of the nightingale. Lord Lindsay tells us of the delight of an evening spent by the Jordan, &quot;the river murmuring along, and the nightingale singing from the trees.&quot; Canon Tristram, describing the scenery near Tell-el-Kady, says that &quot;the bulbul and nightingale vied in rival song in the branches above, audible over the noise of the torrent below.&quot; In the face of these statements it seems to me remarkable, considering the innumerable references to nature in the Bible, that the singing of birds is only mentioned three times. In the well-known passage which so exquisitely depicts a Syrian spring, we read &quot;the time of the singing of birds is come&quot; (Song of Solomon ii. 12). The Psalmist in speaking of the mighty power and wondrous Providence of God, mentions the springs in &quot;the valleys, which run among the hills.

By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches.&quot; Canon Trjstrom commenting on this passage, says, that it may refer especially to the &quot; bulbul and the nightingale, both of which throng the trees that fringe the Jordan and abound in all the wooded valleys, filling ihe air in early spring with the rich cadence of their notes.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Warring </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Bardsley. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><sup>i</sup> &#8226; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Illustrative </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Texts,&quot; </span>1876.</span></p>

When it takes up its abode among mankind, it generally selects the breeding-places which have been built for it by those who know its taste, but it frequently chooses the top of a chimney, or some such locality. When it is obliged to build in spots where it can find neither rocks nor buildings, it builds on trees, and, like the heron, is sociable in its nesting, a whole community residing in a clump of trees. It is not very particular about the kind of tree, provided that it be tolerably tall, and strong enough to bear the weight of its enormous nest; and the reader will at once see that the <span style='font-style:italic;'>fir-trees </span>are peculiarly fitted to be the houses for the stork.</p>

The rejoicing of life depends so much upon the grateful alternation of day and night. For a full consideration of this subject I must refer the reader to Dr. Whewell&#39;s Bridgewater Treatise. The subjoined extracts may, however, aid reflection. &quot;The terrestrial day, and consequently the length of the cycle of light and darkness, being what it is, we find various parts of the constitution both of animals and vegetables, which have a periodical character in their functions, corresponding to the diurnal succession of external conditions; and we find that the length of the period, as it exists in their constitution, coincides with the length of the natural day. The alternation of processes which takes place in plants by day and by night is less obvious, and less obviously essential to their well-being, than the annual series of changes. But there are abundance of facts which serve to show that such an alternation is part of the vegetable</p>

We see that in the day, as it now is, all animals And seasons for taking food and repose, which agree perfectly with their health and comfort. Some animals feed during the day, as nearly all the ruminating animals and land birds; others feed only in the twilight, as bats and owls, and are called <span style='font-style:italic;'>crepuscular; </span>while many beasts of prey, aquatic birds, aud others, take their food during the night. These animals, which are nocturnal feeders, are diurna! sleepers, while those which are crepuscular sleep partly in the night and partly in the day ; but in all, the complete period of these functions is twenty-four hours. Man in like manner, in all nations and ages, takes his principal rest once in twenty-four hours; and the regularity of this practice seems most suitable to his health, though the duration of time allotted to repose is extremely different in different cases. So far as we can judge, this period is of a length beneficial to the human frame, independently of the effect of external agents. In the voyages recently made into high northern latitudes, where the sun did not rise for three months, the crew* of the ships were made to adhere, with the utmost punctuality, to the habit of retiring to rest at nine, and rising a quarter before six; and they enjoyed, under circumstances apparently the most trying, a state of salubrity quite remarkable. This shows, that according to the common constitution of such men, the cycle of twenty-four hours is very commodious, though not imposed on them by external circumstances.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wbewel l </span>(1795&#8212;1866).</p>

Again, the same superiority of knowledge would be displayed by contriving engines of the same kind, or for the same purposes, after different fashions, as the moving of clocks by springs instead of weights: so the infinitely wise Creator hath shown in many instances that he is not confined to one only instrument for the working one effect, but can perform the same thing by divers means. So, though feathers seem necessary for flying, yet hath he enabled several creatures to fly without them, as two sorts of fishes, one sort of lizard, and the bat, not to mention the numerous tribes of flying insects.
