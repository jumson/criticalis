It is a great thing to say &quot; I lovo the Lord &quot; ; for the sweetest of all graces and the surest of all evidences of salvation is love. It is great goodness on the part of God that he condescends to be loved by such poor creatures as we are, and it is a sure proof that he has been al work in our heart when we can say, &quot;Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Because </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>bcard </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>voice </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>supplica</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tions.&quot; </span>The psalmist not only knows that he loves God, but he knows why he does so. When love can justify itself with a reason, it is deep, strong, and abiding. They say that love is blind; but when we love God our affection has its eyes open and can sustain itself with the most rigid logic. We have reason, superabundant reason, for loving the Lord ; and so because in this case principle and passion, reason and emotion go together, they make up an admirable state of mind. David&#39;s reason for his love was the love of God in hearing his prayers. The psalmist had used his &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>voice&quot; </span>in prayer, and the habit of doing so is exceedingly helpful to devotion. If we can pray aloud without being overheard it is well to do so. Sometimes, however, when the psalmist had lifted up his voice, his utterance had been so broken and painful that he scarcely dared to call it prayer; words failed him, he could only produce a groaning sound, but the Lord heard his moaning voice. At other times his prayers were more regular and better formed : these he calls &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>supplications.&quot; </span>David had praised as best he could, and when one form of devotion failed him he tried another. He had gone to the Lord again and again, hence he uses the plural and says &quot;my supplications,&quot; but as often as he had gone, so often hud he been welcome. Jehovah had heard, that is to say, accepted, and answered both his broken cries and his more composed and orderly supplications; hence he loved God with all his heart. Answered prayers are silken bonds which bind our hearts to God. When a man&#39;s prayers are answered, love is the natural result. According to Alexander, both verbs may be translated in the present, and the text may run thus, &quot;I love because Jehovah hears my voice, my supplications.&quot; This also is true in the case of every pleading believer. Continual love flows out of daily answers to prayer.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA281.w.1.1.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.302.1.1.box.141.1509.1305.710.q.60'>2. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Because </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hath </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>inclined </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ear </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>unto </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me&quot; </span>:&#8212;bowing down from his grandeur to attend to my prayer; the figure seems to be that of a tender physician or loving friend leaning over a sick man whose voice is faint and scarcely audible, so as to catch every accent and whisper. When our prayer is very feeble, so that we ourselves can scarcely hear it, and question whether we do pray or not, yet God bows a listening ear, and regards our supplications. &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Therefore </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>call </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>long </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>as </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>live,&quot; </span>or &quot; in my days.&quot; Throughout all the days of my life I will address my prayer to God alone, and to him I will unceasingly pray. It is always wise to go where we are welcome and are well treated. The word &quot; call &quot; may imply praise as well as prayer: calling upon the name of the Lord is an expressive name for adoration of all kinds. When prayer is heard in our feebleness, and answered in the strength and greatness of God, we are strengthened in the habit of prayer, and confirmed in the resolve to make ceaseless intercession. We should not thank a beggar who informed us that because we had granted his request he would never cease to beg of us, and yet doubtless it is acceptable to God that his petitioners should form the resolution to continue in prayer: this shows the greatLess of his goodness, and the abundance of his patience. In all days let us pray and praise the Ancient of days. He promises that as our days our strength shall be; let us resolve that as our days our devotion shall be.</p>

terror with which death is accustomed to bind men ere he drags them away to their long captivity were all around him.

His giiefs were double, and as he searched into them they increased. A man rejoices when he finds a hid treasure ; but what must be the anguish of a man who finds, where he least expected it, a vein of trouble and sorrow? The psalmist was sought for by trouble and it found him out, and when he himself became a seeker he found no relief, but double distress.</span></p>

When the good man could not run to God, he <span style='font-style:italic;'>called </span>to him. In his extremity his faith came to the front: it was useless to call on man, and it may have seemed almost as useless to appeal to the Lord ; but yet he did with his whole soul invoke all the attributes which make up the sacred name of Jehovah, and thus he proved the truth of his confidence. We can some of us remember certain very special times of trial of which we can now say, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>then </span>called I upon the name of the Lord.&quot; The psalmist appealed to the Lord&#39;s mercy, truth, power, and faithfulness, and this was his prayer,&#8212;&quot;O <span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>I </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>besvech </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thve, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deliver </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>soul.&quot; </span>This form of petition is short, comprehensive, to the point, humble, and earnest. It were well if all our prayers were moulded upon this model ; perhaps they would be if we were in similar circumstances to those of the psalmist, for real trouble produces real prayer. Here we have no multiplicity of words, and no fine arrangement of sentences ; everything is simple and natural ; there is not a redundant syllable, and yet there is not one lacking.</p>

It is a great favour to hear a sinner&#39;s piayer, and yet since the Lord has promised to do so, he is not unrighteous to forget his promise and disregard the cries of his people. The combination of grace and righteousness in the dealings of God with his servants can only be explained by remembering the atoning sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the cross we see how gracious is the Lord and righteous. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;Yea, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>merciful,&quot; </span>or compassionate, tender, pitiful, full of mercy.

The worldly-wise with all their prudence shall be taken in their own craftiness, but those who walk in their integrity with single-minded truthfulness before God shall be protected against the wiles of their enemies, and enabled to outlive their foes. Though the saints are like sheep in the midst of wolves, and comparatively defenceless, yet there are more sheep in the world than wolves, and it is highly probable that the sheep will feed in safety when not a single wolf is left upon the face of the earth: even so the meek shall inherit the earth when the wicked shall be no more. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>brought </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>low, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>helped </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>me,&quot;</span>&#8212;simple though I was, the Lord did not pass me by.

is as various as the need of his people: ho supplies our necessities when impoverished, restores our character when maligned, raises up friends for us when deserted, comforts us when desponding, and heals our diseases when we are sick. There are thousands in the church of God at this time who can each one of them say for himself, &quot;/ was brought low, and he helped m&#171;.&quot; Whenever this can be said it should be said to the praise of the glory of his grace, and for the comforting of others who may pass through the like ordeal. Note how David after stating the general doctrine that the Lord preserveth the simple, proves and illustrates it from his own personal experience. The habit of taking home a general truth and testing the power of it in our own c;ise is an exceedingly blessed one; it is the way in which the testimony of Christ is confirmed in us, and so we become witnesses unto the Lord our God.</span></p>

He had rested before, for he knew the blessed repose of faith, and therefore he returns to the God who had been the refuge of his soul in former days. Even as a bird flies to its nest, so does his soul fly to his God. Whenever a child of God even for a moment loses his peace of mind, he should be concerned to find it again, not by seeking it in the world or in his own experience, but in the Lord alone.

Concerning the things of God no man should speak unless he believes; the speech of the waverer is mischievous, but the tongue of the believer is profitable; the most powerful speech which has ever been uttered by the lip of man has emanated from a heart fully persuaded of the truth of God. Not only the psalmist, but such men as Luther, and Calvin, and other great witnesses for the faith could each one most heartily say, &quot;I believed, therefore have I spoken.&quot; &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>was </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>greatly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>afflicted.&#39;&#39; </span>There was no mistake about that ; the affliction was as bitter and as terrible as it well could be, and since I have been delivered from it, I am sure that the deliverance is no fanatical delusion, but a self-evident fact; therefore am I the more resolved to speak to the honour of God. Though greatly afflicted, the psalmist had not ceased to believe: his faith was tried but not destroyed.</p>

But from the expression, &quot;I said in my haste,&quot; it is clear that the psalmist did not justify his own language, but considered it as the ebullition of a hasty temper. In the sense in which he spoke his language was unjustifiable. He had no right to distrust all men, for many of them are honest, truthful, and conscientious; there are faithful friends and loyal adherents yet alive; and if sometimes they disappoint us, we ought not to call them liars for failing when the failure arises entirely from want of power, and not from lack of will. Under great affliction our temptation will be to form hasty judgments of our fellow men, and knowing this to be the case we ought carefully to watch our spirit, and to keep the door of our lips. The psalmist had believed, and therefore he spoke; he had doubted, and therefore he spoke in haste. He believed, and therefore he rightly prayed to God; he disbelieved, and therefore he wrongfully accused mankind. Speaking is as ill in some cases as it is good in others. Speaking in haste is generally followed by bitter repentance. It is much better to be quiet when our spirit is disturbed and hasty, for it is so much easier to say thaa to unsay ; we may repent of our words, but we cannot so recall them as to undo the mischief they have done.<a id='GBS.PA285.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.306.1.0.box.142.279.1304.74.q.60'>

It is of little use to be harping on the string of man&#39;s imperfection and deceitfulness; it is infinitely better to praise the perfectidn and faithfulness of God. The question of the verse is a very proper one: the Lord has rendered so much mercy to us that we ought to look about us, and look within us, and see what can be done by us to manifest our gratitude. We ought not only to do what is plainly before us, but also with holy ingenuity to search out various ways by which we may render fresh praises unto our God. His benefits are so many that we cannot number them, and our ways of acknowledging his bestowments ought to be varied and numerous in proportion. Each person should have his own peculiar mode of expressing gratitude. The Lord sends each one a special benefit, let each one enquire, &#39;. What shall / render?

This seems to indicate that the song was meant to remind Jewish families of the mercies received by any one of the household, supposing him to have been sore sick and to have been restored to health, for the Lord values the lives of his saints, and often spares them where others perish. They shall not die prematurely ; they shall be immortal till their work is done; and when their time shall come to die, then their deaths shall be precious. The Lord watches over their dying beds, smooths their pillows, sustains their hearts, and receives their souls. Those who are redeemed with precious blood are so dear to God that even their deaths are precious to him. The death-beds of saints are very precious to the church, she often learns much from them; they are very precious to all believers, who delight to treasure up the last words of the departed ; but they are most of all precious to the Lord Jehovah himself, who views the triumphant deaths of his gracious ones with sacred delight.

O that children of godly parents would thus judge; but, alas, there are many who are the sons of the Lord&#39;s handmaids, but they are not themselves his servants. They give sad proof that grace does not run in the blood.

There is nothing like witnessing for Jesus, where the report thereof will be carried into a thousand homes. God&#39;s praise is not to be confined to a closet, nor his name to be whispered in holes and corners, as if we were afraid that men should hear us; but in the thick of the throng, and in the very centre of assemblies, we should lift up heart and voice unto the Lord, and invite others to join with us in adoring him, saying, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&#39;&#39;Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord,&quot; </span>or Hallelujah. This was a very fit conclusion of a song to be sung when all the people were gathered together at Jerusalem to keep the feast. God&#39;s Spirit moved the writers of these Psalms to give them a fitness and suitability which was more evident in their own day than now; but enough is perceptible to convince us that every line and word had a peculiar adaptation to the occasions for which the sacred sonnets were composed. When we worship the Lord we ought with great care to select the words of prayer and praise, and not to trust to the opening of a hymn-book, or to the unconsidered extemporizing of the moment. Let all things be done decently and in order, and let all things begin and end with Hallelujah, Praise ye the Lord.</p>

He is imagined by the prophet to have passed through the sorrows and afflictions of life. The atonement is passed. He has risen from the dead. He is on the right hand of the Majesty on High; and he proclaims to the whole world the mercies he experienced from God in the day of his incarnation, and the glories which he has received in the kingdom of his Heavenly Father. Yet, although the psalm possesses this power, and, by its own internal evidence, proves the soundness of the interpretation, it is yet highly mystic in its mode of disclosure, and requires careful meditation in bringing out its real results. Its language, too, is not so exclusively appropriate to the Messiah, that it shall not be repeated and applied by the believer to his own trials in the world ; so that while there is much that finds a ready parallel in the exaltation of Christ in heaven, there is much that would seem to be restrained to his condition upon earth. It therefore depends much on <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>mind </span>of the individual, whether he will receive it in the higher sense of the Redeemer&#39;s glory; or restrict it <span style='font-style:italic;'>solely </span>to a thanksgiving for blessings amidst those sufferings in life to which all men have been subject in the same manner, though not to the same extent as Jesus. The most perfect and the most profitable reading would combine the two, taking Christ as <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>exemplar </span>of God&#39;s mercies towards ourselves.</p>

In the troublous times of my incarnation I was encircled with snares, and urged onwards towards my death. The priest and ruler; the Pharisee and the&#39; &#8226; scribe ; the rich and the poor, clamoured fiercely for my destruction. The whole nation conspired against me. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;The </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>hands </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>grave&quot; </span>laid hold of me.</p>

Then, <span style='font-style:italic;'>truly </span>did Christ find heaviness and affliction. &quot;His soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.&quot; He prayed anxiously to his Heavenly Father, that &quot; the cup might pass from him.&quot; The {ate of the whole world was in the balance; and he supplicated with agony, that his <span style='font-style:italic;'>soul </span>might be delivered.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA288.w.1.4.0'></a><p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;' id='para.309.1.4.box.269.794.1298.247.q.50'>5. The abrupt breaking off in this verse from the direct narrative of his own sorrows is wonderfully grand and beautiful. Nor less so, is the expression &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span>God&quot; as applied by Christ to his own disciples and believers. &quot;/ <span style='font-style:italic;'>called,&#39;</span>&quot; he states, &quot;on. <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lobd.&quot; </span>But he does not yet state the answer. He leaves that to be inferred from the assurance that God is <span style='font-style:italic;'>ever </span>gracious to the faithful; yea, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span>God &quot;&#39;&#8212;the protector of the Christian church, as well as of myself&#8212;&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>our </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>God </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>merciful.&quot; </span></p>

Mark the energy of the language, &quot;I was afflicted; and he delivered me.&quot; And how delivered? The soul of Christ hast returned freely to its tranquillity; for though the body and the frame perished on the tree, yet the soul burst through the bands of death. Again in the full stature of a perfect man Christ rose resplendent in glory to the mansions of eternity. The tears ceased ; the sorrows were hushed; and henceforward, through the boundless day of immortality, doth he &quot; walk before Jehovah, in the land of <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>living.&quot; </span>This last is one of those expressions in the psalm which might, without reflection, seem adapted to the rescued believer&#39;s state on earth, rather than Christ&#39;s in heaven. But applying the language of earthly things to heavenly&#8212;which is usual, even in the most mystic writings of Scripture&#8212;nothing can be finer than the appellation of &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>land </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>living,&quot; </span>when assigned to the future residence of the soul. It is the noblest application of the metaphor, and is singularly appropriate to those eternal mansions where death and sorrow are alike unknown.</p>

Still, oppressed and stricken as he was in soul, he yet trusted in Jehovah, for he felt assured that he would not fotsake him. But, sustained by God, he was deserted by men, the disciples with whom he had lived ; the multitudes whom he had taught; the afflicted whom he had healed, &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span>forsook him and fled.&quot; Not one&#8212;not even the &quot;disciple whom he loved &quot;&#8212;remained; and in the anguish of that desertion he could not refrain from the bitter thought, that all mankind were alike false and treacherous.</p>

I will lift up &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cup </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deliverance&quot;</span>&#8212;the drink-offering made to God with sacrifice after any signal mercies received&#8212;and hless the Lord who has been thus gracious to me.
