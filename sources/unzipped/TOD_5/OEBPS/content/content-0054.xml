It is in these things that the <span style='font-style:italic;'>spiritual </span>sense is required to be separated from the external emblem. For instance, the sacramental cup was without a doubt drawn and instituted from the cup used in commemoration of deliverances by the Jews. It is used figuratively by Christ in heaven; but the reflective mind can scarcely fail to see the beauty of imagining it in his hand in thankfulness for his triumph, <span style='font-style:italic;'>because </span>&quot;he has buret his bonds in sunder&quot; : the bonds which held him fast in death, and confined him to the tomb: the assertion that &quot; precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his saints&quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>specially </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>cludes </span>the sacrifice of Christ within its more general allusion to the blood shed, in such abundance, by prophets and martyrs to the truth. In the same manner the worship of Jehovah in the courts of his temple at Jerusalem is used in figure for the open promulgation of Christianity to the whole world. The temple services were the most solemn and most public which were offered by the Jews; and when Christ is said to &quot;offer his sacrifices of thanksgiving&quot; to God <span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sight </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people, </span>the figure is easily separated from the grosser element; and <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>omver&amp;ion </span>of all people intimated under the form of Christ <span style='font-style:italic;'>seen </span>by all.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Hill </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Tucker. </span></p>

For when a man&#39;s heart is inflamed, and his soul ravished with a deep apprehension of some great and extraordinary favour, his affection will cause interruption in the expression thereof, and make stops in his speech ; and therefore this concise and abrupt clause, &quot;7 <span style='font-style:italic;'>loue,&quot; </span>declareth a more entire and ardent affection than a more full and round phrase would do. Great is the force of true love, so that it cannot be sufficiently expressed. &#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>William </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gouge, </span>1575&#8212;1633.</p>

That if now, O my soul, thou return not to thy rest, thou wilt show thyself to be most insatiable; seeing thou hast not only more than thou didst ask, but as much indeed as was possible to be asked.</span></p>

There is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>lapsus </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>moralis, </span>as 1 Cor. x. 12. Err I? or would David here be understood of sinning? So Ps. lxxiii. 2: &quot;My fvet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.&quot; And if I be not deceived, the text leans to that meaning, rising still from the less to the greater. First. It is more bounty to be kept from grief than from death, for there is a greater enlargement from misery. It is not more bounty to be kept from the sense of affliction than to be kept from death, which is the greatest of temporal evils; but it is mote bounty in a gracious eye to be kept from sin than from death. Secondly, <span style='font-style:italic;'>Huw </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>eyes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>from </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>tears </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>f </span>If not kept from sin?

Still, in a gracious eye, the benefit seems greater to be delivered from sinning than from the greatest outward affliction. This is the reason Paul (Rom. viii. 37) triumphs over all afflictions. 2 Cor. xi. and xii. He counts them his glory, his crown; but speaking of the prevailing of coriuption in particular, he bemoans himself as the miserablest man alive.

Alas! what walking is it in the winter, when all things are dead, when the very grass lies buried under ground, and scarce anything that has life in it is to be seen? But then is the pleasant walking, when nature spteads her green carpet to walk upon, and then it is the land of the living, when the trees shew they live, by bringing forth, if not fruits, at least leaves; when the valleys shew they live, by bringing forth sweet flowers to delight the smell, at least fresh grass to please the eyes. But is this the walking in the land of the living that David means? O my soul, to walk in the land of the living is to walk in the paths of righteousness: for there is no such death to the soul as sin, no such cause of tears to the eyes as guiltiness of conscience, no such falling of the feet as to fall from God : and therefore, to say the truth, the soul can never return to its rest if we walk not withal in the paths of righteousness; and we cannot well say whether this rest be a cause of the walk, or the walking be a cause of the resting: but this we may say, they are certainly companions the one to the other, which is in effect but this&#8212;that justification can never be without sanctification. Peace of conscience, and godliness of life, can never be one without the other.

No, my soul, it serves not his turn, but he must pay them in the presence of all his people; yet not to the end he should bo applauded for a just payer; for though he pay them, yet he can never pay them to the full; but to the end, that men seeing his good works, may glorify God by his example. And the rather perhaps, for that David was a king, and the king&#39;s example prevails much with the people, to make them pay their vows to God : but most of all, that by this means David&#39;s piety may not be barren, but may make a breed of piety in the people also: which may be one mystical reason why it was counted a curse in Israel to be barren; for he that pays not his vows to God in the presence of his people may well be said to be barren in Israel, seeing he begets no children to God by his example. And perhaps, also, the vows which David means here were the doing of some mean things, unfit in show for the dignity of a king; as when it was thought a base thing in him to dance before the ark; he then vowed he would be baser yet : and in this case, to pay his vows before the people becomes a matter of necessity: for as there is no honour to a man whilst he is by himself alone, so there is no shame to a man but before the people : and therefore to shew that he is not ashamed to do any thing how mean soever, so it may tend to the glorifying of God; &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>will </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pay </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>voies </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>presence </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>people.&#39;&#39; </span>And he will do it though it cost him his life, for if he die for it he knows that <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Precious </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sight </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>death </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>saints.&#39;&#39; </span>But that which is precious is commonly desired : and doth God then desire the death of his saints? He desires, no doubt, that death of his saints which is to die to sin: but for any other death of his saints, it&#39; is therefore said to be precious in his sight, because he lays it up with the greater carefulness. And for this it is there are such several mansions in God&#39;s house, that to them whose death is precious in his sight&#39; he may assign the most glorious mansions. This indeed is the reward of martyrdom, and the encouragement of martyrs, though their sufferings be most insufferable, their troubles most intolerable ; yet this makes amends for all; that <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Precious </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>sight </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>lbe </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>death </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>taints.&quot; </span>For if it be so great a happiness to be acceptable in his sight, how great a happiness must it be to be precious in his sight? When God, at the creation looked upon all his works, it is said he saw them to bo all exceeding good: but it is not said that any of them were precious in his sight. How then comes death to be precious in his sight, that was none of his works, but is a destroyer of his works? Is it possible that a thing which destroys his creatures should have a title of more value in his sight, than his creatures themselves? O, my soul, this is one of the miracles of his saints, and perhaps one of those which Christ meant, when he said to his apostles, that greater miracles than he did they should do themselves: for what greater miracle than this, that death, which of itself is a thing most vile in the sight of God, yet once embraced by his saints, as it were by their touch only, becomes precious in his sight? To alter a thing from being vile to be precious, is it not a greater miracle than to turn water into wine? Indeed so it is; death doth not damnify his saints, but his saints do dignify death. Death takes nothing away from his saints&#39; happiness, but his saints add lustre to death&#39;s vileness. It is happy for death that ever it met with any of God&#39;s saints; for there was no way for it else in the world, to be ever had in any account: but why say I, in the world? For it is of no account in the world for all this: it is but only in the sight of God; but indeed this only is all in all; for to be precious in God&#39;s sight is more to be prized than the world itself. For when the world shall pass away, and all the glory of it be laid in the dust; then shall trophies be erected for the death of his saints: and when all monuments of the world shall be utterly defaced, and all records quite rased out; yet the death of his saints shall stand registered still, in fair rod letters in the calendar of heaven. If there be glory laid up for thom that die in the Lord; much more shall they be glorified that die for the Lord.</p>
