What we preach we should practise. The best way to enforce an exhortation is to set an example; but we must let that example be of the best kind, or we may lead others to do the work in a limping manner. David brought nothing less than his whole heart to the duty ; all his love went out towards God, and all his zeal, his skill, and his ardour went with it. Jehovah the one and undivided God cannot be acceptably praised with a divided heart, neither should we attempt so to dishonour him; for our whole heart is little enough for his glory, and there can be no reason why it should not all be lifted up in his praise. All his works are praiseworthy, and therefore all our nature should adore him. &quot;/ti <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>assembly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>upright, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>congregation&quot; </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>;</span>&#8212; whether with few or with mimy he would pour forth his whole heart and soul in praise, and whether the company was made up of select spirits or of the general mass of the people he would continue in the same exercise. For the choicest society there can be no better engagement than praise, and for the general assembly nothing can be more fitting. For the church and for the congregation, for the family or the community, for the private chamber of pious friendship, or the great hall of popular meeting, the praise of the Lord is suitable; and at the very least the true heart should sing hallelujah in any and every place. Why should we fear the presence of men? The best of men will join us in our song, and if the common sort will not do so, our example will be a needed rebuke to them. In any case let us praise God, whether the hearers be a little band of saints or a mixed multitude. Come, dear readers, he who pens this comment is in his heart magnifying the Lord: will you not pause for a moment and join in the delightful exercise?</p>

Even the little things of God are great. In some point of view or other each one of the productions of&#39; his power, or the deeds of his wisdom, will appear to be great to the wise in heart. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Sought </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>out </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pleasure </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>therein.&quot; </span>Those who love their Maker delight in his handiworks, they,perceive that there is more in them than appears upon the surface, and therefore they bend their minds to study and understand them. The devout naturalist ransacks nature, the earnest student of history pries into hidden facts and dark stories, and the man of God digs into the mines of Scripture, and hoards up each grain of its golden truth. God&#39;s works are worthy of our researches, they yield us instruction and pleasure wonderfully blended, and they grow upon, appearing to be far greater, alter investigation than before. Men&#39;s works are noble from a distance ; God&#39;s works are great when sought out. Delitzsch reads the passage, &quot;Worthy of being sought after in all their purposes,&quot; and this also is a grand truth, for the end and design which God hath in all that he makes or does is equally admirable with the work itself. The hidden wisdom of God is the most marvellous part of his works, and hence those who do not look below the surface miss the best part of what he would teach us. Because the works are great they cannot be seen all at once, but must be looked into with care, and this seeking out is of essential service to us by educating our faculties, and strengthening our spiritual eye gradually to bear the light of the divine glory. It is well for us that all things cannot be seen at a glance, for the search into their mysteries is as useful to us as the knowledge which we thereby attain. The history of the Lord&#39;s dealings with his people is especially a fit subject for the meditation of reverent minds who find therein a sweet solace, and a never-failing source of delight.</p>

It is deservedly the theme of the highest praise, and compels those who understand it and experience it to ascribe all honour and glory unto the Lord. Its conception, its sure foundations, its gracious purpose, its wise arrangements, its gift of Jesus as Redeemer, its application of redemption by the Holy Ghost in regeneration and sanctiflcation, and all else which make up the one glorious whole, all redound to the infinite honour of Him who contrived and carried out so astounding a method of salvation. No other work can be compared with it: it honours both the Saviour and the saved, and while it brings glory to God it also brings us to glory. There is<a id='GBS.PA210.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.231.1.0.box.305.298.1290.603.q.60'>

The bearing of guilt by our great Substitute proved that not even to effect the purposes of his grace would the Lord forget his righteousness; no future strain upon his justice can ever be equal to that which it has already sustained in the bruisiug of his dear Son; it must henceforth assuredly endure for ever. Moreover, the righteousness of God in the whole plan can never now be suspected of failure, for all that it requires is already performed, its demands are satisfied by the double deed of our Lord in enduring the vengeance due, and in rendering perfect obedience to the law. Caprice does not enter into the government of the Lord, the rectitude of it is and must for ever be beyond all question. In no single deed of God can unrighteousness be found, nor shall there ever be: this is the very glory of his work, and even its adversaries cannot gainsay it. Let believers, therefore, praise him evermore, and never blush to speak of that work which is so honourable and glorious.</span></p>

By the ordinances of the Mosaic law, the coming out of Egypt, the sojourn in the wilderness, and other memorabilia of Israel&#39;s history were constantly brought before the minds of the people, and their children were by such means instructed in the wonders which God had wrought in old time. Deeds such as God has wrought are not to be admired for an hour and then forgotten, they are meant to be perpetual signs and instructive tokens to all coming generations; and especially are they designed to confirm the faith of his people in the divine love, and to make them know that &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Loud </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>gracious </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>full </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>compassion.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>They need not fear to trust his grace for the future, for they remember it in the past. Grace is as conspicuous as righteousness in the great work of God, yea, a fulness of tender love is seen in all that he has done. He treats his people with great consideration for their weakness and infirmity; having the same pity for them as a father hath towards his children. Should we not praise him for this? A silver thread of lovingkindness runs through the entire fabric of God&#39;s work of salvation and providence, and never once is it left out in the whole piece. Let the memories of his saints bear witness to this fact with grateful joy.</p>

Not only in the wilderness with mannn, but everywhere else by his providence he has supplied the necessities of his believing people. Somewhere or other they have had food convenient for them, and that in times of great scarcity. As for spiritual meat, that has been plentifully furnished them in Christ Jesus; they have been fed with the finest of the wheat, and made to feast on royal dainties. His word is as nourishing to the sou! as bread to the body, and there is such an abundance of it that no heir of heaven shall ever be famished.

No promise of the Lord shall fall to the ground, nor will any part of the great compact of eternal love be revoked or allowed to sink into oblivion. The covenant of grace is the plan of the great work which the Lord works out for his people, and it will never be departed from: the Lord has set his hand and seal to it, his glory and honour are involved in it, yea, his very name hangs upon it, and he will not even in the least jot or tittle cease to be mindful of it.

feeding of his people is the pledge : he would not so continually supply their needs if he meant after all to destroy them. Upon this most blessed earnest let us settle our minds; let us rest in the faithfulness of the Lord, and praise him with all our hearts every time that we eat bread or feed upon his word.</span></p>

This power Israel saw in physical works, and we in spiritual wonders, for we behold the matchless energy of the Holy Ghost and feel it in our own souls. In times of dire distress the Lord has put forth such energy of grace that we have been astonished at his power; and this was part of his intent in bringing us into such conditions that ho might reveal to us the arm of his strength. Could we ever have known it so well if we had not been in pressing need of his help? We may well turn this verse into a prayer and ask to see more and more the power of the Lord at work among us in these latter days. O Lord, let us now see how mightily thou canst work in the saving of sinners and in preserving and delivering thine own people. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;That </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>he </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>may </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>give </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>them </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heritage </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heathen.&#39;<sup>&#39;</sup> </span>He put forth all his power to drive out the Canaanites and bring in his people.

Nothing like artifice or crooked policy can ever be seen in his proceedings; he acts faithfully and righteously towards his people, and with justice and impartiality to all mankind. This also should lead us to praise him, since it is of the utmost advantage to us to live under a sovereign whose laws, decrees, acts, and deeds are the essence of truth and justice. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;All </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>commandments </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>are </span>*&#171;re.&quot; All that he has appointed or decreed shall surely stand, and his precepts which he has proclaimed shall be found worthy of our obedience, for surely they are founded in justice and are meant for our lasting good.

Take the word <span style='font-style:italic;'>commandments </span>to relate either to his decrees or his precepts, and we have in each case an important sense; but it seems more in accordance with the connection to take the first sense and consider the words- to refer to the ordinances, appointments, or decrees of the great King.</p>

The Lord is not swayed by transient motives, or moved by the circumstances of the hour; immutable principles rule in tho courts of Jehovah, and he pursues his eternal purposes without the shadow of a turning. Our works are too often as wood, hay, and stubble, but his doings are as gold, silver, and precious stones. We take up a purpose for a while and then exchange it for another, but he is of one mind, and none can turn him: he acts in eternity and for eternity, and hence what he works abides for ever. Much of this lasting character arises out of the fact which is next mentioned, namely, that they <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;are </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>done </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>truth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>uprightness.&#39;&#39; </span>Nothing stands but that which is upright. Falsehood soon vanishes, for it is a mere show, but truth has salt in it which preserves it from decay.

He has done the like spiritually for all his people, having first by blood purchased them out of the hand of the enemy, and then by power rescued them from the bondage of their sins.

This, too, is reason for the loudest praise. Redemption is a fit theme for the heartiest music, and when it is seen to be connected with gracious engagements from which the Lord&#39;s truth cannot swerve, it becomes a subject fitted to arouse the soul to an eestacy of gratitude. Redemption and the covenant are enough to make the tongue of the dumb sing. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Holy </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rererend </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>is </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>name.&#39;&#39; </span>Well may he say this. The whole name or character of God is worthy of profoundest awe, for it is perfect and complete, whole or holy. It ought not to be spoken without solemn thought, and never heard without profound homage. His name is to be trembled at, it is something terrible ; even those who know him best rejoice with trembling before him. How good men can endure to be called &quot; reverend &quot; we know not. Being unable to discover any reason why our fellow-men should reverence <span style='font-style:italic;'>us, </span>we half suspect that in other men there is not very much which can entitle them to be called reverend, very reverend, right reverend, and <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>So </span>on.

The word &quot; beginning&quot; in Scripture sometimes means the chief; and true religion is at once the first element of wisdom, and its chief fruit. To know God so as to walk aright before him is the greatest of all the applied sciences. Holy reverence of God leads us to praise him, and this is the point which the psalm drives at, for it is a wise act on the part of a creature towards his Creator. &quot;.A <span style='font-style:italic;'>good </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>understand</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>have </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>that </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>do </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>commandments.&#39;&#39; </span>Obedience to God proves that our judgment is sound. Why should he not be obeyed? Does not reason itself claim obedience for the Lord of all? Only a man void of understanding will ever justify rebellion against the holy God. Practical godliness is the test of wisdom. Men may know and be very orthodox, they may talk and be very eloquent, they may speculate and be very profound; but the best proof of their intelligence must be found in their actually doing the will of the Lord. The former part of the psalm taught us the doctrine of God&#39;s nature and character, by describing his works; the second part supplies the practical lejison by drawing the inference that to worship and obey him is the dictate of true wisdom. We joyfully own that it is so. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;His </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>pruise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>endureth </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>for </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ever.&quot; </span>The praises of God will never cease, because his works will always excite adoration, and it will always be the wisdom of men to extol their glorious Lord. Some regard this sentence as referring to those who fear the Lord&#8212; their praise shall endure for ever: and, indeed, it is true that those who lead obedient lives shall obtain honour of the Lord, and commendations which will abide for ever. A word of approbation from the mouth of God will be a meed of honour which will outshine all the decorations which kings and emperors can bestow.</p>

The exhortation is in the first words, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Praise </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lord.&quot; </span>The reasons follow in order. The psalm is composed so after the order of the Hebrew alphabet, as every sentence or half verse beginneth with a several letter of the A B C in order, and all the psalm is of praise only. Whence we learn in general, 1. Sometimes it is expedient to set all other things apart, and employ ourselves expressly to proclaim the praises of the Lord only; for so is done in this psahn. 2. The praises of the Lord are able to fill all the letters and words composed of letters, in all their possible junctures of composition; for so much doth the going through all the letters of the A B C point out unto us, he is Alpha and Omega, and all the middle letters of the A B C (if praise. 3. The praises of the Lord are worthy to be kept in memory: for that this psalm may be the better remembered, it is composed after the manner of the ABC, and so it insinuateth thus much to us.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Datid </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Dickson. </span></p>

Another infeience is similarly suggested&#8212;that our own decision should be given without reference to the result of our appeal. The psalmist did not wait to ascertain whether those whom he addressed would attend to his exhoitation, but, before he could receive a reply, declared unhesitatingly the course he would himself adopt.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>W. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>T. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Mavdsun, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>a </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermon </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Thanksgiving, </span>1855.</p>

His work is honourable and glorious.&quot; My next remark is, that the words used in the original are different, and as the former more strictly signifies <span style='font-style:italic;'>makings, </span>or <span style='font-style:italic;'>things </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>made, </span>so the word in this verse more properly imports a <span style='font-style:italic;'>doing </span>or a <span style='font-style:italic;'>thing </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>done, </span>and this, perhaps, is not without its significance. It leads me to the inference, that from the contemplation of the great works of creation, God&#39;s makings, wonderful, and interesting, and useful as they are, the spiritual mind of God&#39;s servant rapidly passes to some greater deed which the Lord hath done, some more marvellous act which he has accomplished, and which he designates as an honourable and a glorious deed. Now, since I consider that he spoke before of Christ, as the visible and immediate agent in creation, without whom was not anything made that was made, can we hesitate long as to this greater work the rather as to it is immediately subjoined the suggestive sentence, &quot;And his righteousness enduieth forever.&#39;&quot; Is not this doing, the making an end of sin, and the bringing in of an everlasting righteousness?

It is so frequently repeated, th it it may pass for a Scripture maxim, and we may be sure it is of singular importance. Job starts the question, &quot;Where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?&quot; He searches nature through, in quest of it, but cannot find it: he cannot purchase it with the gold of Ophir, and its price is above rubies. At length he recollects the primitive instruction of God to man, and there he finds it: &quot;To man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.&quot;&#8212;Job xxviii. 28. Solomon, the wisest of men, begins his Proverbs with this maxim, &quot;The fear of the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord </span>is the beginning of knowledge,&quot; Prov. L 7.

that holiness of heart and life which is necessary to the enjoyment of cveilasting happiness.
