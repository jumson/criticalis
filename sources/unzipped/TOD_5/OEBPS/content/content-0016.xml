and not merely for the sake of the music or to delight the ears of others. Singing is so delightful an exercise that it is a pity so much of it should be wasted upon trifles or worse than trifles. O ye who can emulate the nightingale, and almost rival the angels, we do most earnestly pray that your hearts may be renewed that so your floods of melody may bo poured out at your Maker&#39;s and Redeemer&#39;s feet. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Talk </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>ye </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>all </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>wondrous </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>works.&#39;&#39; </span>Men love to speak of marvels, and others are generully glad to hear of surprising things; suiely the believer in the living God has before him the most amazing serks of wonders ever heard of or imagined, his themes are inexhaustible and they are such as should hold men spellbound. We ought to have more of this &quot; talk &quot; : no one would be blamed as a Mr. Talkative if this were his constant theme. Talk ye, all of you : you all know something by experience of the marvellous lovingkindness of the Lord&#8212;&quot; talk <span style='font-style:italic;'>ye.&quot; </span>In this way, by all dwelling on this blessed subject, &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>all</span>&quot; his wondrous works will be published. One cannot do it, nor ten thousand times ten thousand, but if all speak to the Loid&#39;s honour, they will at least come nearer to accomplishing the deed. We ought to have a wide range when conversing upon the Lord&#39;s doings, and should not shut our eyes to any part of them. Talk ye of his wondrous woiks in creation and in grace, in judgment and in mercy, in providential interpositions and in spiritual comfoitings; leave out none, or it will be to your damage. Obedience to this veise will give every sanctified tongue some woik to do: the trained musicians can sing, and the commoner voices can talk, and in both ways the Loid will receive a measure of the thanks due to him, and his deeds will be made known among the people.</span></p>

How gladsome all these sentences are! Where can men&#39;s ears be when they talk of the gloom of psalm-singing? What worldly songs are fuller of real mirth? One hears the sound of the timbrel and the harp in every verse. Even seekers find bliss in the name of the Lord Jesus, but as for the finders, we may say with the poet,</p>

The Israelites were the Lord&#39;s elect nation, and they were bound to imitate their progenitor, who was the Lord&#39;s faithful servant and walked before him in holy faith : the seed of Abraham should not be unbelieving, nor should the children of so true a servant become rebels. As we read this pointed appeal to the chosen seed we should recognise the special claims which the Lord has upon ourselves, since we too have been favoured above all others. Election is not a couch for ease, but an argument for seven-fold diligence. If God has set his choice upon us, let us aim to be choice men.</p>

What a joy it is that our God is never absent from us, he is never non-resident, never an absentee ruler, his judgments are in all the places in which we dwell. If the second clause of this verse refers to the whole world, it is very beautiful to see the speciality of Israel&#39;s election united with the universality of Jehovah&#39;s reign. Not alone to the one nation did the Lord reveal himself, but his glory flashed around the globe. It is wonderful that the Jewish people should have become so exclusive, and have so utterly lost the missionary spirit, for their sacred literature is full of the broad and generous sympathies which are so consistent with the worship of &quot;the God of the whole earth.&quot; Nor is it less painful to observe that among a certain class of believers in God&#39;s election of grace there lingers a hard exclusive spirit, fatal to compassion and zeal. It would be well for these also to remember that their Redeemer is &quot;the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.&quot;</p>

If the Lord has his promise in memory surely wo ought not to forget the wonderful manner in which he keeps it.

The Lord was pleased to impress the wild tribes of Canaan with a respectful awe of the pious strangers who had come to abide with them, so that they c:ime not near them to do them ill. The words here mentioned may not have been actually spoken, but the impression of awe which fell upon the nation! is thus poetically described. God will not have those touched who have been set apart unto himself. He calls them his own. saying, <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Mine </span>anointed ;&quot; he declares that he has &quot; <span style='font-style:italic;'>anointed </span>&quot; them to be prophets, priests, and kingsunto himself, and yet again he claims them as <span style='font-style:italic;'>hit </span>prophets&#8212;&quot;Do <span style='font-style:italic;'>my </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>prophets </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>no </span>harm.&quot; All through the many years in which the three great fathers dwelt in Canaan no man was able to injure them; they were not able to defend themselves by force of arms, but the eternal God was their refuge.

remnant according to the election of grace cannot be destroyed, nay, nor so much as touched, without the divine consent. Against the church of Christ the gates of hell cannot prevail. In all this we see reasons for giving thanks unto the Lord, and proclaiming his name according to the exhortation of the first verse of the Psalm. Here ends the portion which was sung at the moving of the ark : its fitness to be used for such a purpose is very manifest, for the ark was the symbol both of the covenant and of that mystic dwelling of God with Israel which was at once her glory and her defence. None could touch the Lord&#39;s peculiar ones, for the Lord was among them, flaming forth in majesty between the cherubims.</span></p>

He could make that famine universal, too, so that all countries should be in like case: then would the race of man fall indeed, and its staff would be broken for ever. There is this sweet comfort in the matter, that the Lord has wise ends to serve even by famine: he meant his people to go down into Egypt, and the scarcity of food was his method of leading them there, for &quot;they heard that there was corn in Egypt.&quot;</p>

His way to a position in which he could feed his family lay through the pit, the slaver&#39;s caravan, the slave market and the prkon, and who shall deny but what it was the right way, the surest way, the wisest way, and perhaps the shortest way. Yet assuredly it seemed not so. Were we to send a man on such an errand we should furnish him with money&#8212;Joseph goes as a pauper ; we should clothe him with authority&#8212;Joseph goes as a slave ; we should leave him at full liberty&#8212;Joseph is a bondman : yet money would have been of little use when corn was so dear, authority would have been irritating rather than influential with Pharaoh, and freedom might not have thrown Joseph into connection with Pharaoh&#39;s captain and his other servants, and so the knowledge of his skill in interpretation might not have reached the monarch&#39;s ear.

His fetters hurt his mind as well as his body, and well did Jacob say, &quot;The archers shot at him, and sorely grieved him.&quot; Under the cruelly false accusation, which he could not disprove, his mind was, as it were, belted and bolted around with iron, and had not the Lord been with him he might have sunk under his sufferings. In all this, and a thousand things besides, he was an admirable type of him who in the highest sense is &quot;the Shepherd, the stone of Israel.&quot; The iron fetters were preparing him to wear chains of gold, and making his feet ready to stand on high places. It is even so with all the Lord&#39;s afflicted ones, they too shall one day step from their prisons to their thrones.</p>

A delayed blessing tests men, and proves their metal, whether their faith is of that precious kind which can endure the fire. Of many a choice promise we may say with Daniel &quot;the thing was true, but the time appointed was long.&quot; If the vision tarry it is good to wait for it with patience. There is a trying word and a delivering word, and we must bear the one till the other comes to us. How meekly Joseph endured his afflictions, and with what fortitude he looked forward to the clearing of his slandered character we may readily imagine : it will be better still if under similar trials we are able to imitate him, and come forth from the furnace as thoroughly purified as he was, and as well prepared to bear the yet harder ordeal of honour and power.</p>

As our Lord was himself secured in Egypt from Herod&#39;s enmity, so, ages before, the redeemed race found an equally available shelter, in the hour of need.
