Thus far but no further did the Lord turn the hearts of the Egyptians. God cannot in any sense be the author of sin so far as to be morally responsible for its existence, but it often happens through the evil which is inherent in human nature that the acts of the Lord arouse the illfeelings of ungodly men. Is the sun to be blamed because while it softens wax it hardens clay? Is the orb of day to be accused of creating the foul exhalations which are drawn by its warmth from the pestilential marsh? The sun causes the reek of the dunghill only in a certain sense, had it been a bed of flowers his beams would have called forth fragrance. The evil is in men, and the honour of turning it to good and useful purposes is with the Lord. Hatred is often allied with cunning, and so in the case of the Egyptians, they began &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>to </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>deal </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>snhtilly </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>with </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>servants.&quot; </span>They treated them in a fraudulent manner, they reduced them to bondage by their exactions, they secretly concerted the destruction of their male children, and at length openly ordained that cruel measure, and all with the view of checking their increase, lest in time of war they should side with invaders in order to obtain their liberty. Surely the depths of Satanic policy were here reached, but vain was the cunning of man against the chosen seed.</p>

The Lord had the men in readiness and all he had to do was to commission them and thrust them forward. They were two, for mutual comfort and strength, even as the apostles and the seventy in our Lord&#39;s day were sent forth two and two. The men differed, and so the one became the supplement of the other, and together they were able to accomplish fax more than if they<a id='GBS.PA50.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.71.1.0.box.305.297.1288.70.q.60'>

The plagues were &quot;words of his signs&quot; (see margin), that is to say, they were speaking marvels, which testified more plainly than words to the omnipotence of Jehovah, to his determination to be obeyed, to his anger at the obstinacy of Pharaoh. Never were discourses more plain, pointed, personal, or powerful, and yet it took ten of them to accomplish the end designed. In the preaching of the gospel there are words, and signs, and wonders, and these leave men without excuse for their impenitence ; to have the kingdom of God come nigh unto them, and yet to remain rebellious is the unhappy sin of obstinate spirits. Those are wonders of sin who see wonders of grace, and yet are unaffected by them : bad as he was, Pharaoh had not this guilt, for the prodigies which he beheld were marvels of judgment and not of mercy.</p>

It was a horiible palpable obscurity which men felt clinging about them as though it were a robe of death. It was a thick darkness, a total darkness, a darkness wnich lasted three days, a darkness in which no one dared to stir. What a condition to be in! This plague is first mentioned, though it is not first in older, because it fitly describes all the period of the plagues: the land was in the darkness of sorrow, and in the darkness of sin all the time. If we shudder as we think of that long and terrible gloom, let us reflect upon the gross darkness which still coviis heathen lands as the result of sin, for it is one of the chief plagues which iniquity creates for itself. May the day soon come when the people which sit in darkness shall see a great light. <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;And </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>they </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>rebelled </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>not </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>against </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>word.&quot; </span>Moses and Aaron did as they were bidden, and during the darkness the .Egyptians were so cowed that even when it chared away they were anxious for Israel to be gone, and had it not been for the pride of Pharaoh they would have rejoiced to speed them on their journey there and then. God can force .men to obey, and even make the stoutest hearts eager to pay respect to his will, for fear his plagues should be multiplied. Possibly, however, the sentence before us neither refers to Moses nor the Egyptians, but to the plagues which came at the Lord&#39;s bidding. The daikness, the hail, the frogs, the murrain, were all so many obedient servants of the great Lord of all.</p>

The beloved Nile and other streams were all equally tainted and ensanguined. Their ce mmonest mercy became their greatest curse. Water is one of the greatest blessings, and the more plentiful it is the better, but blood is a hideous sight to look upon, and to see rivers and pools of it is frightful indeed. Fish in Egypt furnished a large part of the food supply, and it was no small affliction to see them floating dead and white upon a stream of crimson. The hand of the Lord thus smote them where all classes of the people would become aware of it and sufTer from it.</p>

Obnoxious and even loathsome their multitudes became, but there was no resisting them; they seemed to spring out of the ground, the very land brought them forth. Their universal presence must have inspired horror and disgust which would cause sickness and make life a burden; their swarming even in the king&#39;s own chambers was a rebuke to his face, which his pride must have felt. Kings are no more than other men<a id='GBS.PA51.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.72.1.0.box.149.368.1298.178.q.60'>

The meanest beggars were more approachable than the proud Egyptians; they were reduced to the meanest condition of filthinoss, and the most painful state of irritation. What armies the Lord can send forth when once his right arm is bared for war! And what scorn he pours on proud nations when he fights them, not with angels, but with lice I Pharaoh had little left to be proud of when his own person was invaded by filthy parasites. It was a slap in the face which ought to have humbled his heart, but, alas, man, when he is altogether polluted, still maintains his self-conceit, and when he is the most disgusting object in the universe he still vaunts himself. Surely pride is moral madness.</p>

Now the target was struck in the centre, there was no confronting this plague. Pharaoh feels it as much as the woman-slave at the mill: he had smitten Israel, the Lord&#39;s firsthorn, and the Lord repaid him to his face. What a cry went up throughout the land of Egypt when every house wailed its firsthorn at the dead of night!

Glud were the Egyptians to hand over their jewels to propitiate a people who had such a terrible friend above; they needed no undue pressure, they feared them too much to deny them their requests.

Here is the great danger to kings and states, to deal with his saints otherwise than well. Which appeareth many ways; for he doth not only in words give a charge not to touch them, but he carries it in a high way (for so God will do when he pleads their cause). Touch them not; as if he had said, Let me see if you dare si much as touch them ; and it is with an intimation of the highest threatening if they should ; upon your peril if you do so; for that is the scope of such a speech. And accordingly in deeds he made this good; for the text s:iith he suffered no man to do them wrong; not that he did altogether prevent all wrong and injuries, for they received many as they went through those lands; but at no time did he let it go unpunished. In that sense he suffered them not. You know how he plagued Pharaoh, king of Egypt, with great plagues, and all his household, for Abraham&#39;s wife&#39;s sake. Gen. xii. And so Abimelech, king of Gerar, the Lord cometh upon him with a greatness, and his first word is in Gen. xx. 3, &quot;Behold, thou art but a dead man,&quot; afore he had first told him why or wherefore, though then he adds the reason ; he brings him upon his knees, verse 4, bids him look to it, that he give satisfaction to Abraham, and restore his wife to him again, verse ?; and well he escaped so ; and tells him also that he must be beholden to Abraham&#39;s prayers for his life. &quot;He is a prophet,&quot; saith he, &quot;and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.&quot;</p>

By &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>word </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Lord&quot; </span>that <span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;tried </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>him,&quot; </span>the psalmist evidently refers to the dreams of his future destiny which were sent to Joseph from God; and in saying that they tried him &quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>until </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>his </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>word </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>came,&quot; </span>he evidently means that his faith in those promises was tested by his long imprisonment, until the day of his deliverance dawned. Consider for a moment his position, and you will see the purpose of that trial. A youth educated amidst all the quiet simplicity of the early patriarchal life, he was haunted by dream-visions of a mighty destiny. Those visions were mysteriously foretelling his government in Egypt, and the blessings which his wise and just rule would confer on the land; but while unable to comprehend them, he yet believed that they were voices of the future, and promises of God. But the quietude of that shepherd life was not the preparation for the fulfilment of his promised destiny. The education that would form the man who could withstand, firmly, the temptations of Egyptian life with its cities and civilization; the education that would form the ruler whose clear eye should judge between the good and the evil, and discern the course of safety in the hour of a nation&#39;s peril&#8212;all this was not to be gained under the shadow of his father&#39;s tent; it must come through trial, and through trial arising from the very promise of God in which he believed. Hence, a great and startling change crossed his life, that seemed to forbid the fulfilment of that dream-promise, and tempted him to doubt its truth. Sold into Egypt as a slave, cast into prison through his fidelity to God, the word of the Lord most powerfully tried his soul. In the gloom of that imprisonment it was most hard to believe in God&#39;s faithfulness, when his affliction had risen from his obedience; and most hard to keep the promise clearly before him, when his mighty trouble would perpetually tempt him to regard it as an idle dream. But through the temptation, he gained the strong trust which the pomp and glory of the Egyptian court would have no power to destroy; and when the word of deliverance came, the man came forth, strong through trial, to fulfil his glorious destiny of ruling Egypt in the name of God, and securing for it the blessings of heaven. Thus his trial by the word of the Lord&#8212;his temptation to doubt its truth&#8212;was a divine discipline preparing him for the fulfilment of the promise.</p>

Thus Paul with his profound insight into the facts of spiritual experience, says, &quot; The word of the Lord is sharper<a id='GBS.PA60.w.1.0.0'></a><span class='gtxt_body' id='para.81.1.0.box.262.284.1293.747.q.60'>
than a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a <span style='font-style:italic;'>discerner </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>thoughts </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>intents </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>heart.&quot; </span>In illustration of this we may observe that many promises of the Lord come to us, as they came to Joseph, like dream-visions of the future. Visions come to the Christian soul, as grand and wonderful as those which came to the Hebrew youth of old; and they, too, are prophecies of what we are destined to bo. There comes a time when the voice of God is more clearly heard, and the great inheritance revealed. No dream of the night&#8212;no spirit of the dead&#8212;has visited us; but like a spirit some truth of God has entered the soul&#39;s presence-chamber and summoned it to noble aspiration and Christlike endeavour. Then the earnest of the future gleams on life&#39;s horizon. The Sabbath of eternity, with all its balm and music, seems near, and rapt with its glory, we are rousad to all-surrendering zeal. But I appeal to your experience whether it is not true that such revelations of the promise rapidly become limes of trial. Then the mocking voice of unbelief tells us that aspiration is vain. The cold cross-currents of indifference chill the fiery impulses of the heart. We are prisoned like Joseph, by no material bars indeed, but by the invisible bonds of unbelief; and we find it most hard to keep the promise clear and bright, while tempted to believe that our aspirations weie merely idle dreams. And <span style='font-style:italic;'>there </span>is that arousing, by the promise, of the soul&#39;s hidden unbelief, which makes every promise an inevitable trial.</span></p>

Thus the great idea of an undiscovered land across the wastes of the Atlantic smote the soul of Columbus; but it remained a dreamy faith until by opposition and ridicule he was tempted to regard it as a dream, and then it became heroic endeavour, and the land was found. Thus with all men of genius. They stand in the front of their age, with thoughts which the world cannot understand; but those thoughts are dreams until suffering and scorn try the men, and then they are awakened into effort to realise them. Hence God leads us into circumstances in which we are tempted to doubt his promises, that by temptation he may discipline faith into power. There is a wilderness of temptation in every life, and like Christ, we are often led into it, from the solemn hour when we heard the voice, &quot;Thou art my son ;&quot; but like Christ, we come forth strong, through the long, silent wrestling with temptation, to do our Father&#39;s will.</p>

Weariness, loneliness, failure, had wrung from the strong man the cry, &quot;Take away my life for I am not better than my fathers.&quot; The temptation was becoming too strong, and God sent deliverance in the chariot of fire. <span style='font-style:italic;'>Sometimes </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>by </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>transforming </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>height </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>trial </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>into </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>height </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>blessing. </span>The three youths in Babylon had clenched their nerves for the climax of agony, when the fire became a Paradise. So, now, God makes the climax of trial the herald of spiritual blessedness.

temptation to doubt the word of God silently meetened him for its fulfilment. So with us all. We hope not for an Egyptian kingdom, our dream-vision is of a heavenly inheritance, and the palace of a heavenly King. But every temptation resisted, every mocking voice of doubt overcome, is an aid upwards and onwards. Trials, sufferings, struggles, are angels arraying the souls in the white robjs of the heavenly world, and crowning it with the crown that fadeth not away. And when the end comes, then it will be seen that the long dreary endeavour to hold fast the dream-promise&#8212;the firm resolute &quot;no&quot; to the temptation to disbelieve, are all more than recompensed with &quot; the exceeding and eternal weight of glory.&quot;&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Edward </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Luscombe, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span>&quot;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Sermons </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>preached </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>at </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Kings </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Lynn.&quot; </span>1867.</span></p>

Thus all the forms of Egyptian will-worship were covered with shame and confusion by the plagues.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>G. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Murphy, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Commentary </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>on </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Exodus,&quot; </span>1866.</p>

darkness&quot; (Exod. xiv. 20). The darkness which was upon the fare of the earth &quot;in the beginning,&quot; is described by Jehovah in the book of Job as a cloud: &quot;When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick dnrkness a swaddling-band for it &quot; (Job xxxviii. 9). So now the land of Egypt may have been wrapped about by a thick palpable cloud, cold, damp, impenetrable: the people would feel it upon their limbs, as swaddling-bands; the sun would be blotted out by it, and all things reduced almost to a state of death&#8212;of which this ninth plague was in a certain sense the shadow cast before. Such a cloud would be even more terrible in Egypt, sunny Egypt, than in other countries; for there the sky is almost always clear, and heavy rains unknown. But in any place, and under any conditions, it must have been full of horror and misery. Nothing could represent this more forcibly than the short sentence, &quot;Neither rose any from his place for three days.&quot; It was an horror of great daikness; it rested on them like a pall ; they knew not what dangers might be around them, what judgment was next to happen: they had not been forewarned of this plague, and they could not tell but it might be only a prelude to some more awful visitation: their soul melted in them, for fear of those things that might come upon them : they dared not move from chamber to chamber, nor even from seat to seat : wherever they chanced to be at the moment when the darkness fell upon them, there they must remain. Pharaoh might call in vain for his guards; they could not come to him. Moses and Aaron were no longer within reach, for none could go to seek them. Masters could not command their slaves, nor slaves hasten to obey their master&#39;s call; the wife could not flee to her husband, nor the child cling to its parents: the same fear was upon all, both high and low; the same paralysing terror and dismay possessed them every one. As says the patriarch Job, they &quot; laid hold on horror&quot; (Job xviii. 20). And this continued for three days and nights: they had no lamps nor torches; either they could not kindle them, or they dared not move to procure them: they were silent in darkness, like men already dead. Hope and expectation of returning light might at first support them; but hope delayed through seventytwo weary hours would presently die out, and leave them to despair. The darkness would become more oppressive and intolerable the longer it continued; &quot;felt&quot; upon their bodies as a physical infliction, and &quot; felt&quot; even more in their souls in agonies of fear and apprehension; such a darkness as that which, in the book of Revelation, the fifth angel pours out upon the seat of the beast&#8212; &quot;Whose kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds&quot; (Rev. xvi. 10, 11). If there be any truth in the traditions of the Jews on this subject, there were yet greater alarms under this canopy of darkness, this palpable obscurity, than any which would arise out of the physical infliction. Darkness is a type of Satan&#39;s kingdom; and Satan had some liberty in Egypt to walk up and down upon the land, and to go to and fro in it. The Jewish Rabbis tell us that the devil and his angels were let loose during these three dreadful days ; that they had a wider range and greater liberty than usual for working mischief. They describe these evil spirits going among the wretched people, glued to their seats as they were, with terror; frightemng them with fearful apparitions; piercing their ears with hideous shrieks and groans; driving them almost to madness with the intensity of their fears; making their flesh creep, and the hair of their head to stand on end. Such a climax seems to be referred to by the Psalmist, &quot;He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them&quot; (Ps. lxxviii. 49).&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>S. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Millington, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;Signs </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>and </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>W</span><span style='font-style:italic;'>onders </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Land </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ham,</span>&quot; 1873.</span></p>

About the commencement of the rise it assumes a greenish hue, is disagreeable to the taste, unwholesome, and often totally unfit for drinking. It soon, however, becomes red and turbid, and continues in this state for three or more weeks. In this condition it is again healthy and fit for use. The miracle now performed was totally different from this annual change. For, 1, it occurred after the winter, not the summer, solstice; 2. the water was turned into blood, and not merely reddened by an admixture of red clay or animalcula; 3, the fish died, a result which did not follow from the periodical change of colour; 4, the river stank, and became offensive, which it ceased to be when the ordinary redness made its appearance; 5, the stroke was arrested at the end of seven days, whereas the natural redness continued for at least three weeks; and 6, the change was brought on instantly at the word of command before the eyes of Pharaoh. The calamity was appalling. The sweet waters of the Nile were the common beverage of Egypt. It abounded in all kinds of fish, which formed a principal article of diet for the inhabitants. It was revered as a god by Egypt. But now it was a putrid flood, from which they turned away with loathing.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>James </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>G. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Murphy. </span></p>

This sacred and beautiful river, the benefactor and preserver of the country, this birthplace of their chief gods, this abode of their lesser deities, this source of all their prosperity, this centre of all their devotion, is turned to blood : the waters stink; the canals and pools, the vessels of wood and vessels of stone, which were replenished from the river, all are alike polluted. The Nile, according to Pliny, was the &quot; only source from whence the Egyptians obtained water for drinking&quot; (Hist. Nat. 76, c. 33). This water was considered particularly sweet and refreshing; so much so that the people were in the habit of provoking thirst in order that they might partake more freely of its soft and pleasant draughts. Now it was become abominable to them, and they loathed to drink of it.&#8212; <span style='font-style:italic;'>Thomas </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>8. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>MUlington. </span></p>

The quantity of fish in Egypt was a very great boon to the poor classes, and when the Nile overflowed the country inhabitants of the inland villages benefited by this annual gift of the river, as the land did by the fertilizing mud deposited upon it. The canals, ponds, and pools, on the low lands, continued to abound in fish, even after the inundation had ceased ; and it was then that their return to the Nile was intercepted by closing the mouths of the canals.&#8212;<span style='font-style:italic;'>Sir </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>J. </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Gardner </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Wilkinson, </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>in </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>&quot;A </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Popular </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Accuunt </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>of </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>the </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Ancient </span><span style='font-style:italic;'>Egyptians,&quot; </span>1834.</p>
